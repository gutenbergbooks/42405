<p>If this book needs an apology, it is one to myself
for taking the public at large into the confidence of
cherished recollections. The writing was a diversion
from studies in a quite different direction and
letting my pen go, while living again the happy
hours I spent, between arduous duties, with the
beautiful monuments of Java’s past, I did nothing
but seek my own pleasure. Should it turn out that
my personal impressions, given in black and white,
please others too&mdash;so much the better. In any
case they must be taken for what they are: a
beguilement of lone moments of leisure.</p>

<p>Whoever find them readable, they will not satisfy,
I hope, a certain class of critics; those, I mean,
who extend the paltry rule of mutual admiration,
<i>nul n’aura de l’esprit que nous et nos amis</i>, to any
field they claim their own and “of whom to be dispraised
were no small praise.” Desirous, I must
confess, to stimulate their flattering disapproval, I
hasten to admit in advance my many shortcomings,
a full list of which they will doubtless oblige me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
with in due process of censorious comment. My
work sets up no pretence to completeness: there is
no full enumeration of all the Hindu and Buddhist
temples known by their remains; there are no
measurements, no technical details, no statistics&mdash;a
great recommendation to my mind, as Dutch
East Indian statistics go. I am not guilty of an
ambitious attempt to enrich the world with an exhaustive
treatise on ancient Javanese architecture
and sculpture&mdash;far be it from me to harbour such an
audacious design! I disclaim even the presumption
to aspire at being classed as a useful companion on
a visit to the island; I deny most emphatically that
I intend to swell the disquieting number of tourists’
vade-mecums already up for sale, clamouring for
recognition, and, <i>horribile dictu</i>, scores more
coming! Be they sufficient or insufficient, qualitatively
speaking, I am not going to increase their
quantity.</p>

<p>So much for what this book is not. What it is,
I could not help making it, choosing from the
material stored in my memory; reliving, as fancy
dictated in long northern winter evenings, the
sunny spells between 1874 and 1903 when I might
call Java my home; resuming my walks in the
charming island pleasance of the East, fain to leave
the congested main roads and disport myself along
by-paths and unfrequented lanes where solace
and repose await the weary wanderer. The undertaking,
somewhat too confidently indicated by the
title, tempted to excursions off the beaten historical,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
geographical and archaeological tracks, which
perhaps will contribute to a better understanding of
the monuments described in their proper setting,
their relations to natural scenery and native civilisation,
but certainly do not tend to conformity with
the regulation style of compositions of the kind.
Invoking the aid of Ganesa, the sagacious guide,
countenancer of poor mortals in creative throes&mdash;for,
thank Heaven! the fever of production is
indissolubly one with the anguish that heightens its
delights,&mdash;I never hesitated in letting the idea of
self-gratification prevail, even when the question of
illustration arose after the plan had ripened of inviting
indulgent readers to partake. In this respect
too I struggled free from anxious deliberation:
<i>Wer gar zu viel bedenkt, wird wenig leisten</i>. And,
Ganesa aiding, the following kaleidoscopic view
of the land I love so well, was the result of my
delicious travail.</p>

<p>Looking for the flowers in the ill-kept garden of
Java, the delinquencies of the gardeners could not
be ignored and here I touch the unpleasant side of
the recreation I sought, especially disagreeable when
proposing to strangers that they should share; but
a picture needs shade as well as light to become
intelligible. And to paint true to life the picture
of Dutch East Indian passivity (activity only in
vandalism!) regarding treasures of art inconvertible
into cash, shade ought to be preponderant and light
relegated to the subordinate place of a little star
glimmering dimly in the darkness, a little star of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
hope for the future. Disinclined, however, to spoil
my pleasure by dwelling on the tenebrous general
aspect of governmental archaeology in the past, I
have no more than mentioned such disgraceful incidents
as the Mendoot squabbles, and omitted, <i>e.g.</i>, all
reference to such ludicrously heated controversies
as that about the <i>kala-makara</i> versus the <i>garuda-naga</i>
ornament, exhaustive of the energy which
the officially learned might have employed to so
much greater advantage by rescuing the venerable
temples they fought over, from decay and willful
demolition.</p>

<p>The neglect of the ancient monuments of Java
has been nothing short of scandalous, the evil effects
of the habitual languid detachment of the colonial
authorities from the business they are supposed to
look after, being, in their case, intensified by acts
of dilapidation which even a Government centuries
back on the road of enlightenment would have
checked,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> not to speak of downright plunder and
theft. The more honour deserve men like Junghuhn
among the dead and Rouffaer among the still
living, who lifted their voice against the intolerable
negligence which hastened the ruin of some of the
finest existing specimens of Hindu and Buddhist
architecture. At last, in 1901, an Archaeological
Commission was appointed, whose labours were
directed by Dr. J. L. A. Brandes, their head and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
soul. After his regretted death in 1905, he was
succeeded by Dr. N. J. Krom, who has no easy
task in fanning the spark, struck by his predecessor
from the hard flint of official <i>laisser-aller</i> into a
steady, bright flame of real, continuous solicitude for
the country’s antiquities.</p>

<p>Antiquities, except when sold, do not bring
money to the exchequer, and the Dutch Government’s
most holy colonial traditions are diametrically
opposed to expenses without promise of immediate
pecuniary profit. If sympathies in matters alien to
that prime purpose are miraculously aroused, such
interest, revealing itself at the very best by fits and
starts to serve ambitious schemes, soon flags and
dies. Especially in Dutch East Indian enthusiasm
for enterprises financially uncommendable, the adage
holds good that <i>tout lasse, tout casse, tout passe</i>.
The efforts of the Archaeological Commission can
be traced only at the respectful distance of at least a
couple of years, the drowsy dignity of red-tapeism
putting as long a space as possible between the
vulgar gaze of the unofficially curious and the
official accounts of things accomplished, meetly
compiled, arranged, amended, corrected, revised,
purged, padded and bolstered up by the editing
experts of successively the circumlocution offices at
Batavia, Buitenzorg and the Hague. The reports,
published in this manner, whatever they represent
as having been done, lay no stress, of course,
upon what has been left undone, upon the architectural
marvels unprovided for, still suffered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
crumble away, to be stripped and demolished, the
valuable statuary and ornaments to be carried off
piecemeal by unscrupulous collectors, the lower
priced stones they left, sculptured or not, by the
builders of private dwellings and factories, of
Government bridges, dams and embankments.</p>

<p>The illustrations, inserted to explain, imperfect
though it be, the charm of the temple ruins I treated
of, are reproductions of photographs, taken for
the Dutch East Indian Archaeological Service,
I obtained from Messrs. Charls and van Es at
Weltevreden, by courtesy of Dr. N. J. Krom, and
of photographs taken for the Centrum Company at
Batavia, and by Mr. C. Nieuwenhuis and the late
Cephas Sr. at Jogjakarta. The work of restoration
can be appreciated from the photo-prints of the
<i>chandi</i> Pawon and, with respect to the <i>chandis</i>
Mendoot and Boro Budoor, from those facing pp.
<a href="#Page_215">215</a> and <a href="#Page_282">280</a>; they are the numbers 24 and 40 on the
list of the illustrations, and I owe them to Major T.
van Erp, also through the intermediary of Dr. Krom.
My indebtedness for the text so far as it does
not rest on personal observation and information
obtained in the localities referred to, is a very large
one to many authors on many subjects separately
specified in the notes. Concerning the historical
parts, I beg leave to state that my readings on
controversial points have been determined by a
careful sifting of the most acceptable theories
advanced, at the risk of critics of the stamp alluded
to, proving my preferred records absolutely inad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>missible.
If so, I having pulled the long bow
<i>à l’instar</i> of the annalists and chroniclers of ancient
Java, and consequently being shown up for indicating
the way in which things did not happen and could
not have happened, instead of sticking to the
historical truth agreed upon until one of the hall-marked
omniscient makes a name for himself by
inducing the others to agree upon something else,
my sin falls back on the shoulders of the <i>savants</i>
prone to lead their admirers astray by their occasional
imitation of the eminent historian at whose
inborn disrespect for facts Professor Freeman used
to poke fun. I am afraid that the system of
transliteration I adopted, will also meet with scant
recognition in the same quarter, but finding none
that, strictly carried through, adjusts itself equally
well to the exigencies both of Javanese and Malay
names and expressions, I shall adhere to this one
until taught better.</p>

<p>This must suffice for a preface if, indeed, it does
not exceed the measure allowed by my readers’
patience. Knowing Java, they will, however,
excuse my fervour in introducing reminiscences of
beauty breathing scenes which, once enjoyed, linger
like delights in memory</p>

<span class="small">THE COUNTRY, THE PEOPLE AND THEIR WORK</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is the crowning virtue of all great Art that, however little is left
of it by the injuries of time, that little will be lovely. <span class="smcap">John Ruskin</span>,
<i>Mornings in Florence (Santa Croce)</i>.</p></div>


<p>Java’s ancient monuments are eloquent evidence
of that innate consciousness of something beyond
earthly existence which moves men to propitiate
the principle of life by sacrifice in temples as
gloriously divine as mortal hand can raise. Fear,
however, especially where Buddhism moulded their
thought by contemplation intent upon absorption of
self, entered little into the religion of the children of
this pearl of islands. Nature, beautiful, almighty
nature, guided them and their work; even the
terror inspired by the cosmic energy throbbing
under their feet, by frequent volcanic upheavals
dealing destruction and death, flowered into promise
of new joy, thanks to the consummate art of their
builders and sculptors, whose master minds, conceiving
grandly, devising boldly and finishing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
elaborate ornament, emphasised most cunningly the
lofty yet lovely majesty of their natural surroundings.
They made them images of the Supreme Being in
his different aspects and symbolised attributes, free
from the abject dread which dominated his worship
by other earthlings of his fashioning in other climes,
whose notion of All-Power was more one of Vengeance
than of All-Sufficiency. They lived and
meditated and wrought, impressing their mentality
upon the material world given for their use; and
so they created marvels of beauty, developed an
architecture which belongs pre-eminently to their
luxuriant soil under the clear blue of their sky, in
the brilliant light of their sun.</p>

<p>Truly high art ever shows a natural fitness, as
we can observe in our gothic cathedrals, in the
classic remains of Hellas, including those of Magna
Graecia, the temples of Poseidonia, Egesta and
Acragas, the theatres of Syracuse and Tauromenium,
gates opened to the splendour of heaven
and earth by the undying virtue of mortal endeavour.
Other countries, other revelations of the divine
essence in human effort, but not even the shrines of
India as I came to know them, born of a common
origin with Javanese religious structures in almost
similar conditions of climate, physical needs, moral
aspirations, can equal their stately grandeur balanced
by exquisite elegance, calm yet passionate, always
in keeping with the dignified repose of landscapes
which at any moment may have their charms dissolved
in earthquakes, fire and ashes. Angkor-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>Vat,
turned from the service of four-faced Brahma
to Buddhist self-negation, stands perhaps nearest in
the happy effect produced, if not in outline. And
what is the secret of that quiet, subtle magic
exercised by the builders of Java? Nothing but
a matter of technical skill, of such a control over
the practical details of their craft as, for instance,
made them scorn metal bindings, while using mortar
only to a very limited extent? Or was it their
faith, leavening design and execution, attaching the
master’s seal to general plan and minutest ornamental
scroll? In this connection it seems worthy
of remark that architect and sculptor, though
independent in their labours (with the exception
of one or two edifices of a late date), achieved
invariably, in the distribution of surfaces and
decoration, both as to front and side elevations,
complete unity of expression of the fundamental
idea.</p>

<p>Geographically, the ancient monuments of Java
may be divided into three main groups: a western
one, rather scanty and confined to a comparatively
small area; a central one, rich both in Sivaïte and
Buddhist temples of the highest excellence; an
eastern one, including Madura and Bali, illustrative
of the island’s Hindu art in its decadence. Taking
it roughly, the order is also chronologically from
West to East, and to a certain extent we can trace
the history of the remarkable people who improved
so nobly upon the ideas they received from India,
in the ruins they left to our wondering gaze. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
has been a good deal of controversy respecting the
date up to which the inhabitants of Java developed
themselves on lines of aboriginal thought before the
advent of the Hindus or, more correctly speaking,
before Hindu influences became prevalent. In fact,
there is hardly any question regarding the history
of the island and its civilisation before the white
conquerors carried everything before them, which
has not given rise to controversy, and many important
points are still very far from being settled&mdash;perhaps
they never will be. In the face of such
disagreement it behoves us to go warily and what
follows hereafter rests but on arguments <i>pro</i> and
<i>contra</i> deemed most plausible and founded principally
on the accounts of the <i>babads</i> or Javanese
chronicles,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> always liable to correction when new
discoveries with new wordy battles in their wake
bring new light&mdash;if they do! Rude attempts at
rock carving near Karang Bolong, Sukabumi, and
Chitapen, Cheribon, are ascribed by some to artists
of the pre-Hindu period. Professor J. H. C. Kern’s
reading of inscriptions on four monoliths in Batavia,
glorifications of a certain king Purnavarman, proves
that the first Hindus of whom we have knowledge
in Java, were Vaishnavas. Then comes a blank of
several centuries while they made their way to
Central and East Java where, however, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
veil is partly lifted, the Saivas predominate, almost
swamping the rival sect. Fa Hien, the Chinese
pilgrim who visited the island in 412 or 413, having
suffered shipwreck on its coast, speaks of Brahmanism
being <i>in floribus</i> and making converts, but complains
of Buddhism as still of small account among the
natives.</p>

<p>The strangers arrived in increasing numbers on
the hospitable shores of the good and generous
<i>negri jawa</i>, whose kindly reception of those
adventurers is marvellously well represented on
two of the sculptured slabs of the Boro Budoor,
a tale of rescue from the dangers of the sea, a
picture of the past and a prophetic vision of the
welcome extended in later days also to Muhammadans
and Christians&mdash;to be how repaid! The
Hindus acquitted their debt of gratitude by building
and carving with an energy, to quote James Fergusson,
and to an extent nowhere surpassed in their
native lands, dignifying their new home with imperishable
records of their art and civilisation.... The
Venggi inscriptions of the Diëng and the Kadu
leave no doubt that the oldest manifestations of
Hinduïsm in Central and West Java were intimately
related and that the first strong infusion of the
imported creed must have operated until 850 Saka
(<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 928). In 654 Saka (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 732), according to an
inscription found at Changgal, Kadu, the ruler of
the land bore a Sanskrit name and sacrificed to
Siva, erecting a <i>linga</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> An inscription of 700<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Saka (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 778), found at Kalasan, Jogjakarta, is
Buddhistic and confirms the evidence of many
other records carved in stone and copper, of the
oldest Javanese literature, last but not least of the
temple ruins, all concurring in this that the two
religions flourished side by side, the adoration of
the Brahman triad, led by Siva, acquiring a tinge
of the beatitude derived from emancipation through
annihilation of self; Buddhism, in its younger <i>mahayana</i>
form, becoming strongly impregnated with
Sivaïsm, to the point even of endowing the Adi-Buddha
in his five more tangible personifications
with spouses and sons. Between two currents of
faith, each imbued with the male and female
principle in a country where the problem of sex
will not be hid, it depended often upon a trifle
what kind of emblematic shape the sculptor was
going to give to his block of stone, whether he
would carve a <i>linga</i> or a <i>yoni</i>,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> a Dhyani Buddha,
a Bodhisatva, a Tara or one of her Hindu
peers.</p>

<p>Subsequent waves of immigration, the Muhammadan
invasion, the Christian conquests, did little
to nourish the artistic flame; on the contrary, they
damped artistic ardour. Hereanent our historical
data are somewhat more precise. The Islām takes
its way to Sumatra in the wake of trade; conversions
<i>en masse</i> seem to have first occurred in
Pasei and Acheh, while merchants of Arabian and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Persian nationality prepared its advent also in other
regions of the north and later of the west coast.
Marco Polo speaks of a Muhammadan principality
in the North at the end of the thirteenth century;
Ibn Batutah of several more in 1345; Acheh is
fully islāmised under Sooltan Ali Moghayat Shah,
1507-1522; about the same time Menangkabau,
ruled by maharajahs proud of their descent in the
right line from Alexander the Great, Iskander
Dzu’l Karnein, reaches its apogee as a formidable
Moslim state and remains the stronghold of
Malayan true believers until the fanaticism of the
<i>padris</i>, stirred by the Wahabite movement, ends, in
1837, in the submission of the last Prince of Pagar
Rujoong to the Dutch Government, which annexes
his already much diminished empire. About 1400
the Islām had been introduced into Java, Zabej, as
the Arabs called it, probably via Malacca and
Sumatra, more especially Palembang. The oldest
effort recorded was that of a certain Haji Poorwa
in Pajajaran, but it appears not to have met with
great success. Gresik in East Java, a port of call
frequented by many oriental skippers, offered a
better field for the religious zeal of Arab sailing-masters,
supercargoes and tradesmen, every one of
them a missionary too. Maulana Malik Ibrahim
secured the largest following and was succeeded
in his apostolic work by Raden Paku, who settled
at Giri, not far from Gresik, whence his title of Susuhunan
Giri, and by Raden Rahmat, who married a
daughter of Angka Wijaya, King of Mojopahit, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
founded a Muhammadan school at Ngampel, Surabaya.
Their teachings resulted soon in the conversion
of the population of the northeast coast of the
island, where Demak, Drajat, Tuban, Kalinjamat
and a few smaller vassal states of Mojopahit made
themselves independent under Moslim princes or
<i>walis</i>, who at last combined for a holy war against
Hindu supremacy. They wiped Mojopahit in her
idolatrous wickedness from the face of the earth
and the leadership went to Demak, from which
Pajang derived its political ascendency to merge
later in Mataram. While the Islām spread from
Giri in East and Central Java, even to Mataram
and, crossing the water, to Madura, by the exertions
of saintly men who “knew the future,” an Arab
sheik, arriving at Cheribon, directly from foreign
parts, at some time between 1445 and 1490, Noor
ad-Din Ibrahim bin Maulana Israïl, better known
as Sunan Gunoong Jati, undertook the conversion
of West Java. And of Cheribon in her relation to
the Pasoondan may be repeated what a Javanese
historian said of Demak, where the Evil One
was outwitted by the building of a <i>mesdjid</i>,
a Muhammadan house of prayer, the oldest
in the island: two human virtues remained; so
many as embraced the true religion went after
them.</p>

<p>The two remaining virtues got hard pressed
when Christian strangers came to explore and
exploit: Portuguese, English and Dutch, the latter
dominant up to this day. Viewed from the stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>point
of the dominated, their god was a god of
plunder; their emblem, to suit the symbolism of
the Hindu Pantheon, was a <i>maryam</i>, a heavy piece
of ordnance; their <i>vahana</i>, the animal representative
of their most characteristic qualities, was the
tiger, <i>machan</i> still being synonymous with <i>orang
wolanda</i> (Hollander) in confidential, figurative
speech. How Skanda, the deity of war, incited
and Kuwera, the corpulent bestower of riches,
directed their warriors and negotiators after the
appearance of Cornelis Houtman’s ships in the Bay
of Bantam, need not detain us. That story of the
past, with a hint at the possible future, is told in the
legend of the legitimately wedded but for the time
cruelly separated <i>maryams</i> of which one, very
appropriately, awaits the fulfilment of a prophecy at
the capital of the intruders, and the other where
they first put foot on land, both being objects of
veneration and granters of desires, especially kind
to barren women who come, in a spirit of humiliation,
to pray for the blessing of motherhood. A
visit to Batavia is not complete without a pilgrimage
to the Pinang gate, once an approach to the East
India Company’s castle, now in its supernatural
cleanness, with its hideously black funeral urns and
statues of Mars and Mercury or whoever they may
be, giving access to the old town, the first public
monument which attracted the attention of young
Verdant Green in the age of sailing vessels after he
had paid his due to the customs at the <i>boom</i>. Not
far from that Pinang gate, symbolic of a colonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
system under which short weight flourished with
forced labour and trade carried on at the edge of the
sword, lies the man-cannon, Kiahi Satomo, whose
pommel presents a hand, closed so as to make the
gesture of contempt, <i>la fica</i>, which Vanni Fucci of
Pistoja permitted himself when interrogated in the
abode of despair by the poet, <i>quem genuit parvi
Florentia mater amoris</i>, and which accounts for the
peculiar forms sacrifice assumes at this altar. His
favourite spouse, discovered floating on the sea near
old Bantam, an extraordinary thing to do for such a
big heavy piece of metal, was given a temporary
home on the spot where finally she lay down to rest
from her travels: a certain Haji Bool built her a
bambu house after the eruption of Krakatoa in
1883, her presence having saved Karang Antu from
the fate of Anyer and Cheringin. Waiting for the
great consummation, when her reunion with her lord
at Batavia will announce the hour of the oppressors’
defeat and their expulsion from Java, she is not less
honoured than he. Dressed in a white cloth, which
covers the circular inscription in Arabic characters
on breech and cascabel, while the priming hole is
decorated in square ornament, with five solid rings
to facilitate conveyance if she prefers being carried
to moving by her own exertion as of yore, anointed
and salved with <i>boreh</i>,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the spouse, expecting the
summons in the fragrance of incense and flowers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<i>kananga</i> and <i>champaka</i>, is often surrounded by fervent
devotees, muttering their <i>dzikr</i> on their prayer-mats,
grateful for bounty received or hopeful of future
delivery from bondage. Husband and wife will
meet and then a third cannon, far away in Central
Java, in the <i>aloon aloon</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> before the <i>kraton</i><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of the
Susuhunan of Surakarta, inhabited by a ghost, dispenser
of dreams, the <i>sapu jagad</i>, will vindicate
that name, “broom of the world”, by sweeping all
infidels into the sea. Though the scoffing unbeliever
counts this a dream of dreams, to the confiding
children of the land it is a disclosure of things
hidden in the womb of time, not the less true
because Kiahi Satomo has an older mate, Niahi
Satomi, the wife of his youth, the robed in red of
the Susuhunan’s artillery park, which glories in
many <i>maryams</i> renowned in myth and history,
among them another married couple, Koomba-rawa
and Koomba-rawi, who shielded the ancient Sooltans
of Pajang, being the official defenders of their
palace. But Kiahi Satomo’s heart is in Bantam, at
Karang Antu, as Niahi Satomi has reason to suspect
since she, the more legitimate and more
advanced in age, cannot keep him at her side. It
avails nothing that the Susuhunan’s retainers chain
the reluctant head of the family to the Bangsal
Pangrawit, the imperial audience-chamber constructed
after a heavenly model in gold; always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and always he flies back to Batavia, anxious to be
ready where the beloved <i>bini muda</i> (lit. young wife)
has trysted him for sweet dalliance, from which
victory will be born and release.</p>

<p>While predictions of the kind may be laughed at,
the native belief in them and the foundations on
which that belief rests, are no laughable matter by
any means. Stories of mythical beings like Kiahi
Satomo and Niahi Satomi, transformed into pieces
of ordnance connected with the legendary lore of
Trunajaya on one side and Moslim fanaticism
personified in the cannon of Karang Antu on the
other, prove that the native mind is still strongly
imbued with pre-Muhammadan and even pre-Hindu
ideas and modes of thought. Its imagination is fed
by the fortunes (and misfortunes!) of an island
which may be compared in the heterogeneous factors
of its culture with Sicily, where Greek colonists
built their temples in the high places of aboriginal
idolatry; and the Saracens constructed their qubbehs
overtopping the churches and cloisters into which the
Christians had transformed the cellae and colonnades
consecrated to Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Aphrodite,
Pallas Athene, Artemis, the Dioscuri; and the
Normans added their arched doorways and massive
masonry to perplex posterity entirely. In Java the
Hindu element, with a strong Buddhist admixture,
predominates; it prevails wholly in ancient architectural
activity, not to speak of Soondanese and
Javanese folklore and literature, while later Christian
influence is negligible if not negative. Everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
in the island we find under the Muhammadan coating
the old conceptions of life from which the Loro
Jonggrang group and the Boro Budoor sprang:
scratch the <i>orang slam</i> and the Saiva or Buddhist
will immediately appear. As the Padang Highlands,
which preserve the traditions of Menangkabau, still
ring with the fame of the Buddhist King Adityawarman,
and scrupulously Moslim Palembang
still cherishes the memory of Buddhist San-bo-tsaï,
while South Sumatra clings to Hindu customs and
habits for all its submission to Islām, so Java
reveres whatever has been handed down from her
pantheistic <i>tempo dahulu</i> (time of yore), however
attached to the law of the Prophet. Sivaïsm and
Buddhism were deeply rooted in the island; if the
political power of its old creeds was broken in 1767
with the taking of Balambangan, Hinduïsm nevertheless
lingering among the Tenggerese and in Bali,
their spirit goes on leavening the new doctrine
and we meet with their symbolism at every turn.
Not to mention Central Java, where especially
in Surakarta and Jogjakarta their tenacious sway
strikes the most casual observer, the great staircase
of the Muhammadan sanctum at Giri is
adorned with a huge <i>naga</i>, the worshipful rain-cloud
descending in the likeness of a serpent,
despite the Qorānic injunction to abstain from the
representation of animate creation. The pillars of
reception-halls and audience-chambers in the houses
of the high and mighty, East and West, bear a
remarkable resemblance to the <i>linga</i>, witness, <i>e.g.</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the <i>kedaton</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> built by the Sooltan Sepooh Martawijaya
of Cheribon, a Moslim prince who ought
to have evinced the strongest repugnance to Siva’s
prime attribute.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances we need not wonder
that the Islām did so little to stimulate art in Java.
Christianity did still less, rather clogged it in its
application to native industries, which suffered from
the country being flooded with stuff as cheap as
possible in every respect, but sold at the highest
possible prices to benefit manufacturers in Europe.
This is not the place to expatiate on this subject
nor to discuss present efforts (in which alas! personal
ambitions play first fiddle and jeopardise
results) to revive what lies at the point of death
after centuries of culpable discouragement, the
professional secrets and peculiar devices of native
arts and crafts, requiring hereditary skill and the
delicate touch of experienced fingers to attain former
perfection, being now already half forgotten or altogether
lost. Concerning the ancient monuments of
Java, it is to the British Interregnum, to Sir Thomas
Stamford Raffles that we owe the first measures for
their preservation and the first systematic survey of
specimens of Hindu workmanship as beautiful as
any in the world, more in particular of the Prambanan
temples, and also of the Boro Budoor, by
common consent the masterpiece of Buddhist architecture.
Marshalling his assistants in the archaeo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>logical
field, especially Cornelius and Wardenaar
(whose fruitful explorations and excavations deserved
fuller acknowledgment than they received from him),
a diligent student besides of the history and literature
of the island, doing for Java in that respect what
Marsden had done for Sumatra, he inspired Dr.
Leyden, Colonel Mackenzie and his rival John
Crawfurd among his contemporaries, and of younger
generations now equally gone, Wilsen, Leemans,
Brumund, Friederich, Junghuhn, Cohen Stuart,
Holle,&mdash;<i>j’en passe et des meilleurs</i>! The value of
their labours must be recognised and it is the fault
of the Dutch Government’s apathetic attitude that
with such forces at its disposal, so little has been
achieved. Each of them, with few exceptions,
worked independently of the other and blazed his
own personal path in the wilderness of Dutch East
Indian antiquities. There was, as Fergusson complained,
no system, no leading spirit to give unity
to the whole. Disconnected, sometimes misdirected
investigation did not result in more than an accumulation
of fragmentary material for possible future
use, <i>rudis indigestaque moles</i>. And meanwhile the
glorious remains of a lost civilisation went more and
more to ruin. They were drawn upon for purposes
of public and private building; statues and ornament
disappeared, not only in consequence of the unchecked,
persistent nibbling of the tooth of time,
and it seemed almost so much gained if Doorga or
Ganesa reappeared occasionally in the function of
domestic goddess or god to some Resident or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Assistant Resident who demonstrated his devotion
to ancient art and care for the preservation of its
masterpieces by a periodical process of whitewashing
or tarring. Worse than that: dilettantism began to
tamper with the finest temples and the miserable
bungling of mischievous, quasi-scientific enthusiasts
reached its climax in the sorry spectacle prepared
for the visitors of the last international exhibition in
Paris (1900). There was to be seen in the Dutch
East Indian section, a mean, ridiculous imitation of
one of the Buddhist jewels of Central Java, a caricature
of the <i>chandi</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Sari, the exterior in nondescript
confectioner’s style, daubed dirty white, the interior
made hideous by a purple awning, abomination
heaped on abomination. And that piteous botch,
in fact an unconscious avowal of Dutch colonial
shortcomings, did service as a sample of <i>la magnificence
d’une religion prodigue en ornaments, en
feuillages et en voluptés</i>!</p>

<p>After an era of dabbling by pseudo-Winckelmanns
and Schliemanns, spicing their pretences
with mutual admiration, the Government decided
finally to appoint a permanent Archaeological Commission.
Things, indeed, had come to such a pass
that there was danger in delay: the island is becoming
more and more accessible to globe-trotters
of all nationalities, not a few of whom publish their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
impressions, and if erring authority wields a vigorous
Press Law to silence criticism at home, against
foreign criticism it has no weapon of the kind, however
touchy it may be. So it began to move and
the Archaeological Commission (short for Commission
for Archaeological Research in Java and
Madura), though without a single trained archaeologist
among its members, displayed at once a good
deal of activity under its first President, Dr. J. L. A.
Brandes, exploring in East Java, restoring the <i>chandi</i>
Toompang, attending to the Mendoot and Boro
Budoor in Central Java, in order that, acting upon
King Pururava’s injunction, at last understood and
accepted, after a fashion, by Batavia and the Hague,
no monument shall be lost which has been wrought
in the right spirit. It can be imagined that subordinate
officials, eager to follow their superiors’
lead, now revel daily in numberless finds, reported
not only from districts, near and remote, in the star
island, but from the exterior possessions, from
Soombawa, from Jambi in Sumatra, from Kutei in
East, from Sanggau and Sakadan in West Borneo,
etc. etc. Like the encouraging of native art applied
to weaving, wood-carving, the manufacture of pottery,
of household utensils of copper and bronze, and so
on, the ferreting out of sculptural and architectural
ties with the past is quite the latest craze, a
stepping-stone to preferment or at least a means of
ingratiation with those who set the pace. There
would be no harm in this if obsequious ambition did
not burgeon here and there into an excess of zeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
which makes one tremble, pregnant as it proves to
be with dangers well defined by Ruskin: Of all
destructive manias that of restoration is the frightfullest
and foolishest.</p>

<p>Curiosity being excited, there is the impulse to
satisfy vulgar demands, to cater to coarse appetites
when admitting every one who knocks at the door
of the treasure-house however unworthy. Trippers
from the trading centres on the coast swarm round
as their fancies guide; tourists from distant climes
scour the land, either single spies or driven in
noisy battalions of “conducted parties”. Travel in
Java is already assuming the character of holiday
excursions pressed upon the public in bombastic
handbills and posters of transportation companies.
Revenue being the principal objective of Dutch
colonial solicitude, the opportunity they create is
gladly seized to levy gate-money from visitors to
the <i>chandi</i> Mendoot.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And since the Philistines,
who do not appreciate the beauties of a building
they cannot comprehend, expect something in exchange
for their contribution to the upkeep, visible
tokens of their really having been there, we shall
soon hear of photographers established in the
temple to perpetuate the memory of spoony couples,
giggling and offensive, magnesium flashed at the
feet of the Most Venerable, or of the Boro Budoor
in a blaze of Bengal fire to please mediocrity, which
wants barbarous stimulants. And apart from such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
concessions to the exigencies of inane modern
travel, how distressing the plain tokens of neglect
and spoliation! As Psyche began to mourn Love
after she had come to grasp his excellence, so the
discerning one, advancing to the apprehension of
eternal truth there enshrined in beauty, a call to
heaven in stone, laments less what is gone of
material substance by the ravages of time, than
what is taken from the spiritual essence by willful
mutilation; by methods of repair embodied in iron
scrapers to remove moss and weeds, incidentally
spoiling the delicate lines of reliefs and decoration;
by filling gaps with any rubbish lying about, mending
and patching <i>à la grosse morbleu</i>; by additions
for the convenience of sightseers, like the unsightly
staircase askew near one of the original, dilapidated
approaches. It is devoutly to be hoped that the
overhauling now in progress will, at least, remove
such incongruities and avoid new horrors of so-called
restoration.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Brandes, whose learning and good sense led
the Archaeological Commission in a track of sound
activity, died, unfortunately, in 1905. Though the
theft of antiquities has been discontinued on paper,
impudent souvenir hunting is still winked at by
authorities fawning on distinguished guests. Untitled
and unofficial collectors will have some trouble
perhaps, at any rate incur a good deal more expense
than formerly, in filling their private art galleries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
but for officials of the type of Nicolaus Engelhard<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
no difficulties seem to exist and even the Boro
Budoor was very recently despoiled to please a
royal personage. So much for Java; as to the
exterior possessions, the Minahassa was plundered,
even more recently, for the benefit of foreign explorers
of name and fame. Since the respective
Government edicts<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> multiplied, fixing responsibility
at random, cases of strange disappearance multiplied
too, on the principle, it seems, of making hay while
the sun shines; the pen-driving departments, issuing
circulars on everything, for everything, against
everything, about everything, effect absolutely nothing
unless their insistence be taken, often rightly
by him who reads between the lines, for a covert
invitation to do precisely the contrary, considering
friendships, family relations, party obligations, etc. etc.,
of powers and dominions. The force of regulations
and rescripts in the Dutch East Indies is notoriously
short-lived in the best of circumstances, and we
have it on the authority of Hans Sachs, <i>Je mehr
Hürten, je übler Hut</i>. The very scrupulous and
wise, moreover, drag off whatever is loose or can
be detached, separating details of ornament, reliefs
and statues from their surroundings, which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
indispensable to their proper understanding, to hide
and forget them in cellars and lofts of museums
until, the stars being favourable, accidentally rediscovered
after years and years, and ticketed and
huddled together with other ticketed objects in long,
dreary rows of forbidding, bewildering aspect. That
is, <i>if</i> they are rescued and classified and ticketed
<i>tant bien que mal</i>: the colonial section in the Museum
of Antiquities at Leyden, a byword among the lovers
of Dutch East Indian architecture, shows clearly the
obstruction caused by hopeless negligence in the
past and lack of backbone in the present zeal,
energy, ardour, nay, frenzy of investigation. Everything
in Dutch colonial affairs goes by fits and starts
with long blanks of indifference between. To give
but one instance: the <i>Corpus Inscriptionum Javanarum</i>,
planned with flourish of trumpets in 1843,
still awaits the preliminaries of a beginning of execution.
Concerning the fever of restoration which
has broken out, one feels inclined, in support of
Ruskin’s opinion quoted above, to sound the note
of warning engraved on the signet ring of Prosper
Mérimée, Inspector of the Historical Monuments of
France almost a century ago: μέμνασ' ἀπιστεῖν, lest
the last state become worse than the first, and excess
of zeal deface what time and the hand of man, even
the Department of Public Works itself, quarrying
its material for bridges, dams, embankments and
the shapeless Government buildings of which it
possesses the monopoly, have left standing. Without,
however, insisting on the dark aspect of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
situation, let us trust that a sense of shame, if not
of duty, will sustain the interest in the old monuments
of Java now in vogue, and may then the
faddish, pompous display, turned into channels of
quiet, responsible, persistent endeavour, herald a
brighter day!</p>

<p>The Batu Tulis, lit. “the inscribed stone”, near
Bogor, commemorates the feats of a certain prince,
Parabu Raja Purana, otherwise Ratu Dewata, and
calls him the founder of Pakuan, ruler, <i>maharajah
ratu aji</i>, of Pakuan Pajajaran. That kingdom is
the centre of everything tradition has transmitted
regarding the Hindus in West Java. Its origin,
according to native belief, goes back to a settlement
of princely adventurers from Tumapel in East Java,
and when Mojopahit flourished after the fall of that
mighty empire, it rose to equal eminence at the
other end of the island, only to be destroyed by the
same agency, the growing power of Islām. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
subjection of the mountain tribes of the Priangan
by the settlers from the East proceeded in the
beginning but slowly and the children of the land,
even after they had yielded to the inevitable, must
have retained a share in the management of their
affairs, for Soondanese <i>pantoons</i><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> mention separately,
as two factors of government, the <i>ratu</i>, king of
Pakuan, and the <i>menak</i>, nobility of Pajajaran.
However this may be, from about 1100 until the
beginning of the sixteenth century, Pajajaran was a
political unity that counted. She could send an
army of a hundred thousand warriors into the field.
Her kings disposed at will of large territories,
gained by conquest; one of them conferred upon
his brother Kalayalang the dominion of Jayakarta,
in later years better known under the name of
Yacatra, and on his brother Barudin the dominion
of Bantam, principalities destined to play an
important part in the overthrow of the sovereign
state. Nothing, save the meagre accounts of the
<i>babads</i> and the scanty remains to be referred to at
the end of this chapter, reminds now of Pajajaran,
except the Badooy in South Bantam, who constitute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a community apart, entirely isolated from the rest
of the population and whose peculiar customs and
religious observances so far as known, make it
probable that they are the descendants of fugitives
before the Muhammadan inroad.</p>

<p>When Noor ad-Din Ibrahim bin Maulana Israïl
had established in Cheribon not only his religion
but also his political power, he began, under the
name and title of Sunan Gunoong Jati, to propagate
the faith by force of arms in the whole of West
Java. First he cast his eyes on Bantam, then a
mighty realm, the possession or at least the control
of which, leaving spiritual motives alone, would
materially benefit Moslim trade by securing a free
passage through the Straits of Soonda whenever
trouble with the Portuguese made the Straits of
Malacca unsafe. The Sivaïte Prince of Bantam,
trying to preserve his independence by fostering the
commercial rivalry between his Muhammadan and
Christian friends, received the latter with open arms
and besought their assistance against Cheribon
and Demak, but Maulana Hasan ad-Din, a son of
Sunan Gunoong Jati, defeated him none the less
and introduced the Islām among his people both in
Bantam proper and in the Lampongs. Another son
of Sunan Gunoong Jati founded the Muhammadan
principality of Soonda Kalapa, notwithstanding the
fortifications erected there by the Portuguese, at the
instance of their Bantamese ally, to stem the tide
of Muhammadan conquest. After subjugating the
vassal state, Maulana Hasan ad-Din attacked, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
1526, the troops of Pajajaran under the King’s son
Sili Wangi, and routed them, taking the capital and
proselytising by the sword wherever he went,
following the example set by Raden Patah of Demak
in East Java. It is probable that Bantam, once
islāmised and consequently turning against the
Portuguese, took the side of Cheribon in these wars.
At any rate, we find Bantam and Cheribon together
acknowledging the suzerainty of Demak, like the
more eastern principalities of the north coast, and
when that central Muhammadan state of Java lost
the hegemony in consequence of its breaking up
after the death of Pangeran Tranggana, and at last
the Sooltan of Pajang,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> into which it dissolved, had
to humble himself with his allies, the Adipati of
Surabaya and the Sunan of Giri, before the Senapati
of Mataram, his former regent in that territory, this
valiant and clever potentate claimed the lordship
over the island. These were the beginnings of a
glorious new Mataram, perhaps identical with
Mendang Kamulan.</p>

<p>Cheribon, which had conquered Bantam and
Pajajaran, lost gradually her strength, became
tributary to Mataram in 1625 and wholly dependent
in 1632. She declined still more after the death of
Panambahan Girilaya, who divided his succession
between his sons Pangeran Martawijaya (later
Sooltan Sepooh) and Pangeran Kartawijaya (later
Sooltan Anom), on condition of their providing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
a third son, Pangeran Wangsakarta of Godong
(later Panambahan). Embroiled in the rebellion of
Trunajaya against the authority of Mataram and captured,
Martawijaya and Kartawijaya were kept as
hostages at its capital, Karta. Released through the
intervention of Sooltan Tirtayasa of Bantam, more
commonly known as Abu’l-Fatah, they returned
home only to get again mixed up in hostilities
against Mataram and the Dutch East India
Company, which overran Cheribon with its soldiers
and improved the opportunity by regulating the
affairs of Girilaya’s three sons to its own best
advantage. The foundation of Batavia on the site
of old Yacatra, taken by Jan Pietersz Coen, May
30, 1619, had meant, among other things, an always
keener competition in trade with Bantam or, rather,
the “establishment of a free rendezvous”, <i>i.e.</i> free
of bickerings with native princes and princelings,
for the fleets of the Company on their long voyage
to the Moluccos. Bantam having outstripped
Cheribon by the importance she derived from
English and Dutch shipping, resented the blow
which threatened to relegate her to a second or third
place, and this resulted in frequent conflicts with the
intruders, though the boundary line of their settlement
and their mutual relationship had been carefully
defined in the treaty of 1659. On the other side in
occasional difficulties with Mataram, the Company,
acting on the <i>divide et impera</i> principle, encouraged
the rivalry between the middle and western empires,
which both strove for supremacy in the Priangan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
How the Company accomplished its purpose and
triumphed, needs here no detailed examination. Its
objects and the considerations which moved it, are
wittily discussed in a Javanese mock-epic, the <i>Serat
Baron Sakendher</i>, a satire on the rise of Dutch
power at Batavia, the foundation of Moor Yang
Koong (Jan Pietersz Coen). If that pattern of
regents <i>outre mer</i>, the first Dutch Governor-General
in Java, whose motto was “never despair”, whose
grip like the grip of the tiger, has invited comparison
with Ganesa (firstborn of Siva and Parvati)
for wisdom and cautious statecraft, with Skanda
(also sprung from the Mahadeva’s loins but without
the Devi’s collaboration) for resolution and mettle,
here we find him as the son of Baron Sookmool,
Baron Sakendher’s brother, and Tanaruga,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> daughter
of the Pajajaranese Princess Retna Sakar Mandhapa,
and the poet makes the personification of the
Company say to his twelve hopefuls, the earliest
Tuan Tuan Edeleer, or honourable members of the
Governor-General’s Council: Good measures you
will enforce, without quarrelling amongst yourselves,
and, even if it were larceny, the moment you have
decided upon it by common consent, I give my
permission,&mdash;a speech delightfully in keeping with
the tactics of his father, whose artillery prevailed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
not with iron cannon-balls, but with golden grapeshot
of ducats and doubloons.</p>

<p>The ruins of the Fort Speelwijck and the minaret
of Pangeran Muhammad’s <i>mesdjid</i> at Old Bantam
are very illustrative of the insinuating way in which
the pioneers of the Company planted their factories;
once admitted on the strength of their promises,
they gained a firm footing by military superiority,
driving hard bargains and ousting the Islām from
what it had come to regard as its own. Near by is
the neglected, overgrown Dutch cemetery, where
many of those pioneers were laid to rest, far from
home, family and friends, killed in the Company’s
battles or by strenuous obedience to exacting orders,
bartering their health in a murderous climate for a
handful of silver, wasting body and soul to swell
the Company’s dividends. A tangle of weeds and
briars closes over their remains; thick moss, covering
their broken gravestones, effaces their forgotten
names; even the mausoleums dedicated to the
memory of the leaders among them, commanders
and commercial agents-in-chief, are crumbling away,
harbouring hungry guests which leave safe lairs in
the forests, when deer and wild pigs become scarce,
to raid at night the village sheepfolds, while snakes
may dart forth from the cracks and fissures at any
moment and mosquitoes swarm round in myriads,
the worst plague of all to him who seeks communion
with the dead in that jungle. The burial-ground
of the Sooltans of Bantam, gathered round Hasan
ad-Din, the first preacher of the true faith in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
region, is in better condition. Though Shafei, to
whose <i>madsheb</i> or school the Moslemin of the Dutch
East Indies belong, disapproved of elaborate tombs
and prescribed that sepulchral cavities, after the
deposition of the bodies, should be filled up and
made level with the ground, memorial tokens to
mark the graves of Muhammadan saints, famous
princes and heroes, often venerated as <i>kramats</i>, are
a familiar sight in Java; they consist generally of
pieces of wood or stone, <i>tengger</i>, standing upright
at both ends, at the head and at the feet, differently
shaped for men and for women. Many such are
found where Pangeran Muhammad raised his <i>mesdjid</i>
with the minaret detached like the campanile of
some mediaeval Italian church. Tombs all round,
tombs of Sooltans, their brothers and sons and
cousins, their great councillors and generals, a
Bantamese Aliscamps with Hasan ad-Din occupying
the place of honour under a canopy, prayer-mats and
prayer-books lying around, a benign breeze stirring
the muslin hangings and filling the air with the
fragrance of the <i>kambojas</i>.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Whoever wants to
know of the excellent deeds of the Sooltans of
Bantam, their acts of devotion in peace and their
prowess in war, can receive information from
Pangeran Muhammad Ali in <i>kampong</i> Kanari, one
of their descendants, keeper of the archives of the
<i>mesdjid</i> and the surrounding garden of the departed.
He will tell furthermore of the well near the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
wall of the new building, which is fed from the well
Zemzem at Mecca and, thanks to the child Ishmaïl,
beneath whose feet its water bubbled forth, possesses
the property of curing disease. It is also connected
with the miraculous source at Luar Batang, whose
water possesses the property of detecting perverters
of the truth: the man who tries there to slake his
thirst with a falsehood on his conscience, from a
downright lie to a terminological inexactitude, or
even a little fib for the sake of domestic tranquillity,
will not be able to swallow a drop, his throat refusing
liquid comfort until expiation of guilt; and so the
devotees who flock to the shrine of the saint of
Hadramaut at Pasar Ikan, Batavia, leave that source
prudently alone&mdash;one may have sinned unwittingly
or under strong provocation. Such holy places are
thickly strewn and the last habitation of Hasan
ad-Din is one of the holiest, being overshadowed by
the venerable minaret of Pangeran Muhammad’s
<i>mesdjid</i>, which signified to Bantam what the <i>mesdjid</i>
of Ngampel did to the eastern and the <i>mesdjid</i> of
Demak to the middle states of Moslim Java. The
intact preservation of the latter as the oldest existing
edifice erected<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> for Muhammadan worship in the
island, is of high importance <i>superstitionis causa</i>,
and exceeding care was taken in 1845, when the
danger of its tumbling down became imminent,
to rebuild it not all at once, but one part after
the other, round the four principal supports of the
original structure, and to restore the beautifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
carved lintels and posts exactly to their accustomed
position. Nothing is left at Demak of Raden
Patah’s princely dwelling, but the graves are shown
of Panambahan Jimboon, Pangeran Sabrang Lor
and Pangeran Tranggana, who was killed by one
of his servants on an expedition to still Sivaïtic
Pasuruan.</p>

<p>Pangeran Tranggana had auxiliaries from Bantam
among his troops and this leads us back to West
Java after our slight digression in favour of Demak,
the energetic central state which, at the time here
spoken of, ruled the roast in matters of conquest
for the propagation of the faith. The Bantamese,
more than their converters, have conserved a reputation
for fanaticism and it is not yet a quarter of a
century since a certain Abool Karim of the district
Tanara preached the holy war, the brotherhood of
the Naqshibendyah fanning the flame of sedition he
kindled. His <i>murids</i> (disciples) Tubagoos Ismaïl,
Marduki and Wasid having spread the movement,
a mob, led by a certain Haji Iskak, massacred
several Europeans at Chilegon (1888). But for the
Government’s bayonets, rather than a course of
conciliation based on a thorough knowledge of the
agrarian causes at the bottom of the unrest among
the population, the whole of Bantam might have
blazed up and Cheribon might have followed.
Seeing that they could not prevail, the dissatisfied
betook themselves again to prayer, there at the
grave of Hasan ad-Din, here at the grave of Sheik
Noor ad-Din Ibrahim, situated not far from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
capital he founded, on a hill near the sea, the
Gunoong Jati, whence his title. The terraces of
the <i>astana</i> so called, first home of the Islām in this
region, much venerated however much defaced,
savour of more ancient heathen monuments in all
their odour of Muhammadan sacredness, not otherwise
than the <i>Kitab Papakam</i>, the Cheribon code of
laws, savours of Indian maxims and even at this
date betrays its birth from the legislation introduced
by the Hindu immigrants, though in 1768 (and not
before that year, more than three centuries after
the introduction of the law of the Prophet!), the
<i>Kutara Manawa</i> has officially been abrogated in
the Sooltanate. The lowest three terraces of the
<i>astana</i> serve as a burial-ground for the descendants
of Sunan Gunoong Jati and the men of mark in the
annals of his empire; a road, winding upward, a
Moslim Via delle Tombe, conducts the pilgrim to a
<i>mesdjid</i> on the fourth, not to be desecrated by the
feet of unbelievers;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> above the <i>mesdjid</i>, on the
fifth, the <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>, rest the mortal remains
of the saint himself. Speaking of Cheribon
in its relations to Hinduïsm and the Islām, a reference
to Chinese influences on Javanese architecture
cannot be omitted. They are most evident, of
course, where the sons of the Flowery Empire
have settled earliest and in greatest numbers. In
several localities Chinese temples are found for the
building and decorating of which renowned archi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>tects,
wood-carvers and painters have expressly
been summoned to Java at great expense. Reputedly
the finest is the <i>klenteng</i>, situated at a
stone’s throw from the shed wherein Sunan
Gunoong Jati’s <i>grobak</i> is kept, the vehicle in
which he descended from heaven to proclaim the
Word. Transplanting their curved roof-trees and
gaudy ornament, the Chinese brought also a taste
for grotto-work, once notably conspicuous in the
<i>kraton</i> of Sooltan Anom. On the road to Tagal,
near the <i>dessa</i> (village) Sunyaragi, lies a rocky
labyrinth belonging to the pleasure-grounds of
Sooltan Sepooh’s famous country-seat. Among
other clever devices it contains an artificial cave so
constructed that the <i>kanjeng goosti</i>, retiring thither
on a hot afternoon for dalliance with his favourite of
the hour, might shut himself completely off from
the world by a discreet artificial waterfall, securing
privacy behind its liquid screen and a refreshing
atmosphere stimulative to amorous exercise. The
Chinaman who elaborated the idea, had his eyes
gouged out to prevent his creating another such
wonder of architecture adapted to the diversions of
oriental potentates.</p>

<p>It seems fitting that in Java, the sweet island
whose air is balm and where always the delicious
sound of running water is heard, where the cult of
bathing is perfected by inclination as well as necessity
of climate, some of the oldest signs of civilisation
are found in sheltered nooks and corners still
frequented by those who appreciate an invigorating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
plunge. Kota Batu, near Bogor, the supposed site
of the capital of Pajajaran, is an instance in point.
Destroyed, says the Soondanese tradition, because
the illustrious King Noro Pati had lifted up his
heart to boast against the message of the Prophet,
his sons completed the calamity by their wrangling
for the lordship over outlying, as yet unsubjugated
and unconverted dependencies, and righteousness
left the country. The same reasons which made
Pajajaran slow to accept the Islām, had hindered
her acceptance of Hinduïsm. The mountainous
Priangan was sparsely populated and, even if we
accept the statements of native historians who give
Hindu civilisation in West Java a long life by dating
the colonisation from India back to the first century
of the Christian era,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> confined to a limited area, as
the antiquities discovered make clear, it remained
far behind that which reared the superb temples of
Central Java. To the best of our knowledge there
were never any Hindu temples at all in West Java,
where the people seem to have contented themselves
with prayer and sacrifice in the open. While
Central Java attained to the loftiest and noblest in
art, West Java vegetated until improved communication,
stimulated by war and trade, brought about a
dissemination of more eastern artistic notions, discernible
in raised levels and terraces as those of
Gunoong Jati, which remind one faintly of the
Boro Budoor; in earthen walls as those on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Bukit Tronggool, which are arranged after a plan
somewhat like that of the squares enclosing the
principal temple and the surrounding smaller ones
of the <i>chandi</i> Sewu. Even then Polynesian clumsiness
was not shaken off. At Batu Tulis, a <i>kampong</i>
in the outskirts of Bogor, where the hosts of
two religions fought the battle which decided the
fate of Pajajaran, are several ungainly images and
impressions of the feet of Poorwakali, the spouse of
one of that realm’s petrified kings, who mourned
him with such copious tears that she softened the
very rock she stood upon, according to one legend;
and, according to another legend, of the feet of a
certain Raja Mantri who tarried so long in contemplation
of the inscribed stone already mentioned,
pondering over the meaning of its strange characters,
that he sank gradually into the hard ground.
There are more impressions of more feet and a
coarsely carved <i>linga</i>, Siva’s fecundating attribute,
transformed by Muhammadan piety into the miracle
working staff of a Moslim santon. Hardly greater
interest is awakened by the primitive statues Kota
Batu derives its appellation from, “city of stones”,
which form a sort of <i>Ruhmes Allee</i>, lining the path
from the main road to the bath-house, with many of
the same pattern scattered to right and left. All of
them are petrified worthies of Pajajaran, which their
own mothers would not recognise, though the natives
know each of them by praenomen, nomen, cognomen
and title. King Moonding Wangi, <i>i.e.</i> the
nice-smelling buffalo, looking perhaps a trifle more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
human than the rest. Of a similar nature are the
<i>archadomas</i>, a collection of about eight hundred
blocks of stone on the estate Pondok Gedeh, which
need a vivid imagination in the beholder to pass for
the figures of men and animals. A good specimen
of the Pajajaran type of sculpture, if it deserves that
name, is the lachrymose Poorwakali already referred
to as standing, petrified herself, at a little distance
from the Batu Tulis where she solaces her widowhood
by keeping company with Kidangpenanjong,
forgetting her royal husband, after her paroxysm of
grief, in a plebeian flirtation. Such is woman!</p>

<p>From these crude attempts at a representation
of animate creation, sprang nevertheless an art
which, in the hands of the master-builders and
sculptors of Central Java, who sought the beauty
of truth that is verily without a rival, flowered out
in prayers of stone, visible tokens of their yearning
for heavenly reward, born of communion with the
divine in deep reflection, only to descend again to
lower planes, to the seeking of the praise of man, in
the decadent conventionality of the later eastern
Hindu empires. The story of the development of
architecture and sculpture in the island from the
immaturity identified with Pajajaran to the luxurious
grandeur of the temples of Prambanan, the Mendoot
and the Boro Budoor, hides a riddle no less strange
than that of the bursting forth of Arabic poetry, full-blown
in all its subtleness of thought, exuberance of
imagination, perfection of language. The story of
decline is written in the evolution of decorative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
design: the significance of motives based on the
observation of the earth and her precious gifts,
evaporates gradually in nicely waving lines, elaborate
scrolls, insipid fineries. The <i>kala</i>-head changes
into the roots of a tree, figurative of the forest; the
trunk of Ganapati into its bole; at last the tree,
roots, trunk, branches, foliage and all, with the sun
rising over the forest, with mountains touching the
sky, with rivers flowing to the sea, into conventional
ornament. Islāmic ideals were not conducive to
a revival of artistic conceptions fading into nothingness;
neither was, to repeat that too, the painful
contact with Christian civilisation. When the
natives were made to toil and moil for alien masters,
their virtues and energies blighted into the defects
and failings of apathy. How could it be otherwise
where an inefficient, venal police and a slow, defective
administration of justice did (and does) not
protect property against depredation; where exertion
beyond what is strictly necessary for bare subsistence,
meant (and means) not prosperity but increased
taxation. With all its pretensions to superiority
and display of ethical sentiment, the Dutch Government
can scarcely be said to differ much from Baron
Sookmool, the personified East India Company
of more than three centuries ago. Holland’s wards
in her rich colonies may be moulded into men,
angels or devils, like the Triloka, the triple people
of the Hindus, according to the treatment meted
out to them and the education they receive. As far
as Java is concerned, hoping in heaven’s mercy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
they live in their old traditions, the light of the
past and the shadow of the present. What will
the future bring in advance of the day on which
mankind shall be scattered abroad like moths?
There is no knowledge of it but with God and the
secret lies behind the Banaspati,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> in the hand of
him of the budding lotus-flower, the Deliverer from
Evil.</p>

<p>Where five residencies&mdash;Samarang, Pekalongan,
Banyumas, the Bagelen and the Kadu&mdash;meet
between two seas, the wonderland of the Diëng
links the eastern and western chain of volcanoes
which are the vertebrae of Java’s spine. The
Diëng plateau, the first part created, as tradition
goes, and destined to remain longest above water
in the island’s final destruction and submersion, is
nothing but a huge crater. Nature, in her most
mysterious mood, exercises here a charm of a
peculiar character, well expressed by the name,
according to the Javanese derivation from <i>adi aëng</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> marvellously beautiful.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The temples in this
region belong to the oldest and finest if by no
means the largest of Java. The discovery of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
stone with a Venggi inscription has led to the
conjecture that the Hindu settlement to which we
owe them, originated from the Priangan; other
indications point to immigration directly from
Southern India. However this may be, the dates
ascertained (one in an inscription reproduced by
me in 1885 for further examination at Batavia,
leaving the stone in the place where I had found it)
from 731 Saka (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 809) on, witness to the lost
civilisation of the Diëng having reached its apogee
at the time the Abbassides flourished in Baghdad
and the Omayyads in Cordova. How it rose,
declined and fell, we do not know. For four centuries
its memory lived only as a fantastic tale, the
Diëng remaining utterly deserted, a wilderness of
mountain and forest, inhabited by devils and demons
of the Khara and Dushana type.</p>

<p>Resettled since about 1800, its villages increase
in number and size, and its wild animals, big and
small, disappear gradually, though the tigers are
still troublesome, evincing a growing disposition to
vary their accustomed fare with domestic kine and
sheep. The sombre woods are gone and efforts at
reafforestation gave so far no perceptible results.
The ground yields abundant crops of cabbage,
onions and tobacco, in which a lively trade is done
with Chinese middlemen, who buy for the merchants
at Pekalongan, whence the product is shipped to
larger centres of trade. These middlemen congregate
principally at Batoor, a prosperous village, where
travellers to the Diëng, arriving from that side, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
appreciate the hospitable disposition of the <i>wedono</i>,
the native chief of the district. Many a one has
been entertained under his roof, looked down upon
from the <i>palupooh</i> (split bambu) walls by the Royal
Family of Great Britain and Kaiser Wilhelm in
chromolithographic splendour, while discussing a
substantial lunch or arranging for sleeping accommodation
if too tired to push on, or desirous of
visiting the Pakaraman, the valley of death, at break
of day when the uncanny manifestations of that
place of horror are strongest. Another source of
income for some of the Chinamen of Batoor and
their henchmen of the Diëng is opium smuggling.
The geographical position, commanding access to
five administrative divisions of the island at once,
lends itself admirably to that lucrative business.
And if the smugglers cater to a low vice, they can
advance an excuse logically unanswerable by those
in authority who punish them when caught: they
satisfy but a demand, in competition with the
Government that created it, introduced the drug
and encourages its use, artificially whetting a
depraved appetite and demoralising the children
of the land for the sake of more revenue.</p>

<p>Often though I went up to forget the cares of
exacting duties in happy holidays on the Diëng,
trying the different approaches, the impressions of
my first ascent in October 1885 are freshest in my
memory. Starting from Wonosobo, I preferred
to a more direct route the roundabout way via
Temanggoong, spending a day on the road between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the twin volcanoes Soombing and Sindoro, enjoying
the views to right and left, every new turn disclosing
new wonders: mountain slopes basking in the
warmth which radiated triumphantly from a sky of
dazzling brightness, valleys of perfect loveliness
losing their brilliant hues in the shades of evening
as if a curtain fell between the world left and the
world entered. The following morning early I rode
from Temanggoong in a thick mist which, rolling
away before the sun, uncovered a landscape more
and more rugged as I passed Parakan and Ngadirejo,
but always more charming, a feast to the eye.
Near Ngadirejo the <i>chandis</i> Perot and Pringapoos
claimed my attention. Built for the worship of
Siva, his <i>sakti</i> Doorga and their eldest son, they
offered a sad spectacle of decay, the former crumbling
away in the baneful embrace of a gigantic
tamarind, one of whose branches rose from the midst
of the ruin straight up to heaven, overshadowing
Ganesa, the conqueror of obstacles, in his meditations;
the latter holding an image of Siva’s <i>vahana</i>
or <i>nandi</i>, the bull, symbol of his creative power,
still an object of veneration as the <i>boreh</i> indicated,
the walls of the temple being decorated with splendid
bas-reliefs representing a scene from Javanese
history or mythology, analogous to the rape of the
Sabine women.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Farther on, surprise succeeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
surprise, lies Joomprit, another delicious spot,
sanctified by a holy grave, at the source of the
Progo. The water, gushing forth from the mouth
of a cavern and trickling down its sides, is immediately
lost to sight in a declivity among the ferns.
Curious monkeys herd round, led by their brawny
chief, imperious like Hanoman, born from the wind,
swinging through space, commanding the simian
army of Sugriva: they constitute one of the few
colonies of sacred apes which form a living link
with the Hindu epoch; that of Gaja Moongkoor
on the Diëng has ceased to exist.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 353px;">

</a>
<div class="caption">II. <i>CHANDI</i> PRINGAPOOS<br />(Archaeological Service through Charls and van Es.)</div>
</div>

<p>From Joomprit on, it was pretty steep climbing
to a point where, at a sudden turn, I beheld the
lowlands, far beneath the clouds gathering round
me, fair plains resting under their hazy veil of midday
repose, calm and undisturbed. Drinking deep
of the invigorating mountain air, I noticed the red
cheeks of the women and girls who returned from
market in little groups. After descending to the
tea-plantations of Tambi, the clambering up began
again, pretty hard for my pony, to which I gave an
occasional rest, looking back over hills and valleys
as they dissolved in soft-melting tints, impressing
the beholder with a sense of eternal light in limitless
space. Wonder akin to awe seized me when,
panorama-like, a landscape of silent grandeur, quite
different from the graceful majesty of the rose-gardens
of Wonosobo and the palm-groves of
Temanggoong, unfolded itself. I was on the Diëng
plateau. Notwithstanding the late hour, my admira<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>tion
of the scenery having made my progress slow,
I could not resist the temptation to dismount and
follow the trail which led me down to the source of
the Serayu beside the road, and pay my compliments
to the shade of stalwart Bimo by way of introduction
to the regions resounding in its temples with
his exploits and those of other worthies sung in
the <i>Brata Yuda</i>.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Nor indeed only in its temples:
this same delightful retreat commemorates Bimo’s
prowess according to a legend which in its astonishing
account of his supernatural virility cannot be
repeated. Enough to say that Arjuno, making him
dig up the <i>toog</i> Bimo, on the advice of Samār, the
wily, was the first, by determining the course of the
Serayu, to direct the water from the mountains of
Central Java to the sea, therewith obtaining the realm
of Ngastino. And whoever takes a bath, alone
and at night, in the water springing from mother
earth under the <i>pohoon chemeti</i>, the weeping willow
of Bimo’s fountain, will have no occasion for certain
elixirs largely advertised in daily and weekly papers,
will retain youthful vigour into hoariest age.</p>

<p>It was dark when I arrived at the <i>pasangrahan</i>,
the Government rest-house, received first by a
shaggy, plumetailed dog of the Diëng variety,
suspicious of strangers. Her name proved to
be Sarama, suggesting classical associations not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sustained, I am sorry to record, by her master, mine
host, a Swiss, retired from service in the Dutch
colonial army and put in charge of the place.
Speaking innumerable languages and every one of
them as if it were a <i>lingua franca</i> composed of all
the others, he showed me my room, took orders for
my supper and made me comfortable, the broad,
perpetual smile on his honest face illumining our
polyglot conversation. Alas! Wielandt is no more.
Indra, who knows men’s hearts, has certainly assigned
to this diamond, more polished, presumably,
in its celestial than in its former terrestrial state,
a worthy station among the jewels of the city of
bliss, Amaravati. A man of family instincts, good
Wielandt left several daughters, at the time of my
visit of initiation extremely shy little girls; and a son,
then Sinjo Endrik, the obliging and attentive, ever
ready to act as a guide to and otherwise to assist
his father’s guests on their excursions, now Tuan
Endrik, his father’s successor in the <i>pasangrahan</i>,
while one of his brothers-in-law keeps a small,
private hotel, opened to meet the increasing influx
of sightseers and seekers of health. The Diëng
plateau, especially in the dry season, would be an
ideal site for a sanatorium. The sufferer from the
debilitating heat on the coast in the enervating
conditions of a continuous struggle for the next
dollar or official preferment with fatter salary, may
find there rest and a cool climate. Going to the
bath-room before setting out early on some expedition,
I have often found miniature icicles pendent from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
<i>panchuran</i>, the water conduit, and riding off, have
often heard, in crossing a puddle, the thin coating of
ice crackle under the hoofs of my pony. Sometimes,
at sunrise, the few remaining temples stand out
white, the whole plateau being covered with frost,
which makes a strange impression on one who
but the day before yesterday sweltered in the
fiery furnace of, for instance, the Heerenstraat at
Samarang.</p>

<p>Waking up the morning after my first arrival,
feeling cold, though the scene my eyes met was not
quite so severely wintry as that just described, my
dreams seemed to continue in reality. I beheld a
tranquil plain different in its bright serenity from
everything I had so far seen anywhere else, the Bimo
temple rising to the left and the Arjuno group to the
right, sharply outlined against the hills and the sky,
their dark-gray colour in wonderful harmony with the
verdure of earth and the blue expanse of heaven.
One moment they appeared near in the clear atmosphere
as if I could seize them with my hand, and
then again very, very far, never to be approached.
A vapour, clinging to the slope of the Pangonan in
the direction of the Kawah Kidang, reminded me of
the tremendous cosmic energy entering into the composition
of this soothing stillness, this tonic for the
sick and worried, with the certainty of annihilation
as final pledge of freedom. Once a lake of seething
lava, the plateau lies enclosed by the tops of five
mountains, the Prahu, Sroyo, Bismo, Nogosari and
Jimat, 2050 metres above the level of the sea; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Pangonan and Pagar Kandang are old eruptive
cones, formed of the mud and sand thrown out,
which accumulated at their bases and raised the
surrounding ground. The plateau in its narrower
sense is now a flat stretch of turf, in places, especially
in the middle, a morass, called the Rawa Baleh
Kambang for its northern, and the Rawa Glonggong
for its southern part. Ruins have been found everywhere
in the plain and up the slopes of the hills,
even up to the summit of the Prahu. Here stand
stone posts in a row, used by Arjuno, according to
the legend, to tether his elephants, while his cows,
after grazing on the Pangonan, were corralled for the
night in the hollow of the Pagar Kandang, lit.
“fence of the cattle-pen”; there, as in Diëng
Kidool, layers of ashes among the slags and other
debris, mark the situation in the past of the burning-grounds,
which yield a steady harvest of bronze and
gold finger-rings, bracelets, anklets and other objects
of personal adornment. Ancient aqueducts, walls,
staircases, foundations of secular buildings, clustered
round the temples, remains of an important religious
centre, so various and rich that Junghuhn did not
exaggerate when calling them inexhaustible, suggest
the existence, once upon a time, in those mountain
wilds, of a Javanese Benares, minus the Ganges but
plus a setting of unceasing volcanic activity, which
demolished it by a sudden, violent outbreak. Such
suggestions need only the seconding of one of the
learned to be utterly ridiculed by his equally learned
brethren of an opposite school.... We will let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
matter rest at that and simply enjoy the actual calm
of a landscape evidently exposed to destruction at
the shortest notice, of nature recuperating from outrageous
debauch.</p>

<p>Voices solemn and sweet summon to close
communion with the power behind those manifestations,
the universal soul of things human and superhuman,
infernal and divine. One look more at the
strip of turf which clasps the mysteries as a girdle
embossed with gems, the Arjuno and Bimo shrines,
shining in the splendour of early morning,&mdash;we shall
return to them after our stroll of orientation. In
the <i>dessa</i> Diëng Wetan, close to the <i>pasangrahan</i>, is,
or rather was, the <i>watu rawit</i>, a wall constructed of
big blocks of stone, two portions of which still exist
with a narrow staircase, hewn on a smaller scale,
leading to the coping. The structure, largely drawn
upon for building material, goes also by the name of
<i>benteng</i> (fort of) Buddha, an appellation incompatible
with the Sivaïte origin of Diëng architecture and
a contradiction in terms besides, considering the
character of Gautama’s teaching; but in native
parlance everything connected with the Hindu
period is referred to as belonging to the <i>jaman buda</i>,
while the expression <i>agama buda</i> includes every
pre-Muhammadan ancestral religion. Via Patak
Banteng, Jojogan and Parikesit the <i>dessa</i> Simboongan
may be reached, until recently the highest in Java
(2078 metres). Founded in 1815 by the grandfather
of the present <i>lurah</i>, or chief of the village,
its inhabitants, on whose stature and colour of skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the cool climate has had a visible influence, are
very prosperous, their principal occupation being
the preparation of a hair-oil from the seeds of the
<i>gandapura</i> (<i>Hibiscus Abelmoschus</i>). Simboongan
lies on the west bank of Telaga Chebong, one of the
many lakes which add to the indescribable charm of
the Diëng, some possessing uncanny echoes, some
being yellow and sulphurous, some of ever changing
hue, some of crystalline clearness and stocked with
goldfish, while the marshy shores are a favourite
haunt of <i>meliwis</i>, a kind of duck much prized as food
and becoming correspondingly scarce. Proceeding
to Sikunang we get beautiful views in the direction
of Batoor, hidden among its Chinese graves and
orchards as in an airy robe of white and green; along
the mountain rills which hasten impetuously to the
valley of Banjarnegara, meeting in the radiance of
the sun’s promise for union with the sea; down
to the ricefields of Temanggoong, resplendent at the
feet of the high mountains which keep guard over
the Kadu, a paradise dominated by the sister
volcanoes Soombing and Sindoro, a joy to behold.</p>

<p>Passing Sikunang and turning round the
Gunoong Teroos, a spur of the Pakuojo, we notice
some trachyte steps, the head of a staircase made
for the convenience of pilgrims from what is now the
residency Bagelen, to the city of temples, an ascent of
five thousand feet. Over a long distance, following
the course of the river Lawang, that gigantic roadway
can be traced far below Telaga Menjer by
stones left in holes from which it was not easy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
remove them for building purposes. Another of these
<i>ondo buda</i> on the north side of the plateau, served
the pilgrims coming from what is now the residency
Pekalongan, via Deles and Sigamploong, and disappeared
in the same manner. Descending, a smell
of sulphur announces a lion of the Diëng of a less
innocent, in fact of a decidedly satanic aspect: on this
soil always the unsuspected turns up, the remains
of an ancient civilisation forcing themselves upon
our attention together with impressive reminders
of the subterranean forces which extinguished it.
From a number of cavities on the slope of the
Pangonan, bare of vegetation, a picture of desolation,
noxious vapours rise and bubbles of mud are blown
forth and burst with a rumbling noise. High above
the rest works the Kawah Kidang, the deer-kettle,
spouting and growling, throwing the hot liquid round
with relish, and it is advisable to keep her well to
leeward on her days of gala, for she changes
frequently her aim and her mood, an index of Kala’s
disposition when stirring the bowels of the earth.
Being the pulse of the Diëng, so to speak, she is
regularly excited to fiercer exertion by the rainy
season, differing also in this particular from the
Chondro di Muka, her rival near the Pakaraman,
with whom she has been confused even by
geographers of name, greatly to her disparagement
since she commands a considerably wider sphere of
influence, not scrupling to encroach upon the domain
of her neighbours by moving about. Wherever one
pokes into the ground within her sphere of action,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the steam rushes out and seething puddles are
formed; it is wary walking and the wise will take
warning from the foolhardy Contrôleur whose
curiosity prompted him a step too far: sinking
through the upper crust into the boiling mud, he
had his legs so badly burnt that he died of the consequences
and was buried at Wonosobo instead of
marrying his Resident’s daughter at Poorworejo.</p>

<p>With its mofettes, solfataras, steam-holes, mud-geysers,
sulphurous lakes, its treacherously opening
and closing chasms,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> last but not least its notorious
valley of death,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> the Diëng is the region above all
others in volcanic Java, of miracles that expound the
antagonism between fratricide life and death on our
turbulent planet, which continuously prepares for
or recovers from spasms of generative destruction.
One of these spasms, on a grander scale than usual
in the short span of human history, was the eruption
of Krakatoa in 1883; which raised and submerged
islands, shaking and altering the Straits of Soonda,
a resultant tidal wave razing the towns of Anyer
and Cheringin. The Diëng, some three hundred
miles off, responded faithfully, as might have been
expected, the Kawah Kidang roaring and splashing
mud furiously, the wall of the crater-lake Chebong
cracking in several places, so that part of its water,
instead of flowing through the old channel, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
seeks its way through the fissures thus created,
remunerative tobacco-fields being transformed into
swamps. Such disasters preach an eloquent sermon
on the text, hewn in stone by the builders of the
temples here erected to Siva as Kala, the Overthrower,
and, transmitted with the wisdom of ages
by a later religion, happily expressed by the
German poet:</p>

<p>The news that a troop of strolling players had
arrived, dispelled, however, ideas of that sort, unpalatable
truth never proving successful against
the pleasurable excitement of the moment. They
were going to perform at the house of the reputedly
wealthiest man of the plateau and not the less
highly considered by his neighbours because
caught redhanded, not once but repeatedly, in
handling the forbidden, as I heard afterwards.
Living near one of the enclosures traditionally
associated with the pyres which were extinguished
when the Hindu priests deserted their altars, he
gave the <i>ton</i> to the upper ten of Diëng society,
“disporting like any other fly” unterrified by daily
manifestations of cosmic potency. Surrounded by
his <i>ganadavatas</i>, gods of the second rank, he
welcomed me to the show. Mounted on sham
horses, the actors delighted their audience with a
sham battle which soon became a single combat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
between two valiant knights, encouraged by masked
clowns, funny yet exquisitely graceful in their movements:
the <i>savoir vivre</i> of this people is perfectly
matched with their elegance of carriage and correctness
of speech and innate propriety of demeanour.
The comedians’ stage-properties did not amount to
much and their inventive genius shone the more
brilliantly: a tiger (for a hunt of his highness our
common uncle<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> followed the joust) was improvised
with jute bagging and two pieces of wood, representing
the jaws, snapping ferociously, perhaps a
compliment to the <i>orang wolanda</i> present, his biped
equivalent in native estimation, as already remarked.
Or an allusion may have been intended to local
events: not longer than a week before, Paman had
tried to force Wielandt’s stable, cooling his wrath,
when baffled, on Sarama’s pups.</p>

<p>So much for my recollections of the histrionic
exercises on the Diëng, and now about the
temples! If Thomas Horsfield, in his narrative of
the tour he made through the island between 1802
and 1807, mentioned the so-called Buddha-roads, it
was Raffles who sent Cornelius, Lieutenant in the
Corps of Engineers, to survey the architectural
remains on the Diëng plateau proper, which the
earlier traveller had not visited. According to the
official account of his mission, kept in the library of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the Museum of Antiquities at Leyden and still unpublished,
he found whatever was standing of some
forty groups, covered with clay and volcanic ashes
up to nearly a fourth of the original height. Captain
Baker, also commissioned by Raffles, worked three
weeks on the Diëng after his examination of the
ruins at Prambanan and the Boro Budoor. Junghuhn,
whose observations date from 1838 to 1845, speaks
of more than twenty temples in a wilderness of
marshy woods. The woods have disappeared, the
marshes hold their own and of his twenty temples
only eight are left in a recognisable shape: five of
them belong to the Arjuno group, including the
so-called house of Samār; the best preserved is the
Wergodoro or Bimo; the Andorowati and Gatot
Kocho crumble away even faster than the rest.
It has already been remarked that the Diëng
structures belong to the oldest in the island, the
<i>hanasima</i> inscription, transferred to Batavia, furnishing
a record of the Diëng civilisation which goes
back to 731 Saka (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 809). They are interesting
to the Indian antiquary, wrote Fergusson, “because
they are Indian temples pure and simple, and
dedicated to Indian gods ...; what (they) tell us
further is, that if Java got her Buddhism from
Gujerat and the mouths of the Indus, she got her
Hinduïsm from Telingana and the mouths of the
Kistnah.... Nor are (they) Dravidian in any sense
of the word. They are in storeys, but not with
cells, nor any reminiscences of such; but they are
Chalukyan.” Later learning accepts this statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
only with cautious reserve. Whether Chalukyan
or not, though, it is plain even to the unlearned
that, erected to Siva, the Mahadeva worshipped
principally in his character of Bhatara Guru, the
divine teacher, to his <i>sakti</i> Doorga and their first-born
Ganesa, these temples, radiating the all-soul
in the fierce glare of the midday sun, unfolding
their secrets in the mellow moonbeams of night,
partake fully of their mysterious surroundings, are
integral portions of the ground they occupy, as may
be said of all ancient Javanese buildings. Men of
great power of imagination, deep-reasoning sentiment,
the builders of these marvels, working their
thoughts up to the sky, rescued for us the essence
of the Diëng’s past existence. Their apprehension
of universal happiness without beginning or end,
sharpened by the desire to enjoy heaven on earth,
lent immortality to the greatness of a people every
vestige of whom would have disappeared but for
their creative enthusiasm.</p>

<div class="caption">III. <i>CHANDI</i> ARJUNO ON THE DIËNG PLATEAU<br />(Archaeological Service through Charls and van Es.)</div>
</div>

<p>Prurient prudery, keen on the scent of the nasty,
feels shocked at the <i>lingas</i> and <i>yonis</i> lying round,
unable in its fly-blown purity to grasp the divinity
of eternal love in the poem of generation, the union
of the Deva and the Devi in causation and conception
of life. The Philistine sees little more than
rubbish, heaps of stone of no earthly use except as
havens of refuge when out shooting <i>meliwis</i> and
overtaken by rain. In the Rawa Baleh Gambang
we find five such clustered together, the <i>chandis</i>
Arjuno with the house of Samār, Srikandi (Ongko<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Wijoyo), Poontadewa (Trumo Kasumo or Sami
Aji) and Sembrada (Sepropo), the chief hero of the
<i>Brata Yuda</i> being honoured in the midst of family
and friends, including his funny and faithful servant.
The <i>kala-makara</i><a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> ornament of the entrance to the
<i>chandi</i> Arjuno tells its tale; so do the empty
niches designed for free-standing statuettes dissolved
into space. Like the <i>chandi</i> Srikandi it was once
surrounded by a wall and another point of resemblance
is the small rectangular building called
the <i>chandi</i> Samār, probably destined for secular
purposes; of the Srikandi dependency, however,
only the base can be traced. The <i>chandi</i> Sembrada
deviates somewhat in architectural plan and detail,
and the ground-idea of the decoration can be studied
to best advantage in the <i>chandi</i> Poontadewa, finest
of the group, exquisitely graceful on its high basement.
Here again the <i>makara</i> ornament prevails,
budding into leaves and flowers, chiselled with a
chaste appreciation of the esthetic principle of self-control:
<i>In der Beschränkung zeigt sich erst der
Meister</i>. Under the tapering roofs, fallen or falling
in, which give the inner chambers an air of indescribable
elegance, notwithstanding the cramped
dimensions, images of holiness stood on pedestals;
the images have been removed, heaven knows
whither, and even the pedestals have fared badly at
the hands of sacrilegious robbers digging for hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
treasure. Trumo Kasumo, supposed to keep
sentinel over his <i>chandi</i> (in bas-relief, north side),
cannot but be scandalised at modern methods of
research and modern behaviour in general.</p>

<p>The morass shows, in the dry season, the foundations
of buildings, regularly arranged, lining streets
which intersected at right angles over a considerable
part of the Rawa Baleh Gambang. Their disposition
has been advanced to support the theory
that the population of the Diëng lived in wooden
houses, built on those substructures of stone. The
theory that the superstructures of stone have been
carried away and the submerged substructures left
because not so easy to get at, is just as plausible;
perhaps a little more so. But whatever they were,
temples and priestly or private dwellings of wood
or stone, the officiating clergy, their assistants and
the inhabitants of the city ministering to their
fleshly needs, must have suffered a good deal from
the dampness of the soil, the plateau offering
already in those early days a field of rich promise
for the experiments of hydraulic engineers. Among
canals and ditches of less importance, the Guwa
Aswotomo, a <i>cloaca maxima</i> some twelve centuries
old, still relieves the plain of its superfluous water.
According to the legend, for nothing in this locality
goes without at least one,&mdash;according to the legend
then, the subterraneous passage was dug by
Aswotomo on his expedition to the Diëng for the
purpose of smashing the Pandawas, and nearing
Arjuno’s residence he pushed his way up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
surface, from distance to distance, spying how far
he had yet to continue his underground march.
Descending into one of the peep-holes he made,
in a season of extreme drought, I was able to crawl
on to the next, through mud and debris which
blocked my further progress and, unable to crawl
out on a level fifteen or twenty feet lower, the
watercourse sloping deeper and deeper down, I
had to return to my point of ingress. The glory
of this feat diminishes in the light of my knowledge
of the circumstance that the Diëng plateau harbours
no snakes,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> save the decorative <i>nagas</i> of temple
architecture, and that a companion followed my
movements above ground; had we been provided
with ropes, we might have carried our work of
exploration much further&mdash;but that must wait for
another time. Of the rare plant which grows
nowhere but in Aswotomo’s burrow and owes its
growth to his copious perspiration while at his task,
a fern possessing rare qualities, highly beneficial to
him who pulls it out by the roots, I saw or, rather,
felt nothing in groping my way through mire and
darkness. Taking its course in a direction inverse
to the mole-man’s initial tunnel boring, his Guwa
begins at the Arjuno temples as an unpretentious
drain and runs, for about half a mile, slanting toward
the source of the river Dolok, where Junghuhn has
set up two <i>lingas</i>.</p>

<div class="caption">IV. <i>CHANDI</i> BIMO OR WERGODORO ON THE DIËNG PLATEAU<br />(Archaeological Service through Charls and van Es.)</div>
</div>

<p>The largest remaining and most beautiful
temple on the Diëng is the <i>chandi</i> Wergodoro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
or Bimo,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> where the Pangonan rises out of the Rawa
Glonggong. Notwithstanding Fergusson’s opinion,
competent critics, deriving their conclusions from
the horizontal lines of the roof-storeys, maintain
its Dravidian or Southern Indian instead of
Chalukyan character.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The niches with busts,
which impress one as windows with people poking
out their heads to see who is disturbing their quiet,
suggest an approach to ideas further developed in
the architecture of the plain of Prambanan. These
curious persons look out only at the back and at
the sides; the niches of the roof in front, over the
projecting porch with <i>kala-makara</i> ornament, are
all empty. With its entrance facing east, in
contradistinction to those of the other temples
on the plateau, which face west, the <i>chandi</i> Bimo
possesses also notable peculiarities in the details of
its sculpture: the double lotus of the cornice,
lotus-buds and diminutive bo-trees of uncommon
shapes, etc., while the upward tapering structural
design displays a tendency to the slightly curved
lines so dearly loved by Greek builders of the best
period and adapted by the masters of early Gothic.
The larger, lower niches have been despoiled;
architraves and mouldings, festooned with foliage,
flowers and seed-pods, divide the open spaces round
about in a tasteful, sober manner, exciting without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
fatiguing the eye. From the fact that the decoration
has not been completed, it is inferred that the
sculptors were interrupted like their comrades at
work on other monuments of Central Java, overwhelmed
perhaps by the catastrophe of volcanic or
martial nature, which depopulated the Diëng and
coincided with the decline of the ancient empire of
Hindu Mataram. The miraculous voice heard in
the <i>chandi</i> Bimo at dead of night, is silent on this
point. All temples have their <i>shetans</i>, their bad,
rarely good spirits, but the <i>genius loci</i> of the Bimo
excels the whole Arjuno crowd of them in efficacy
and unfailing attention to the business of the
seekers of advice, who arrive from far and wide
to consult the oracle. Entering after dusk the
gate of the Dread One, Kala, one with Rudra, the
Roarer (the Kawa Kidang) near by, they have but
to wait in prayer at the altar of the wondrous fane.
A strange whisper, mounting like the odour of
<i>melati</i> and <i>kenanga</i>, tells them how to avoid the
grim giant Danger if, on leaving, they are firmly
determined to pursue the road of Good Desert.</p>

<p>The <i>chandis</i> Gatot Kocho and Andorowati,
falling into hopeless ruin, will soon be remembered
only by their location, like the <i>chandi</i> Parikesit, and it
is a pity to think of those which left no trace at all,
whose very names are forgotten. The state of affairs
on the Diëng plateau, said Captain, now Major T.
van Erp,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> commissioned for the restoration of the
Boro Budoor, leaves everything to be desired....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Villages came into existence and expanded. The
inhabitants need stone substructures in building
their houses and it is a matter of course that they
use temple stones for that purpose; these are here
much smaller than those of the monuments in the
valley of the Progo and the plain of Prambanan,
easily carried off and exactly of the right size....
This is the case of the spoliation of the temples on
the Diëng in a nutshell. But it should be added
that the natives are not the only offenders. So
much, indeed, is implied in Major van Erp’s
anecdote of a tourist who, examining the statuary
adorning the grounds of the <i>pasangrahan</i>, a remarkable
collection formed from miscellaneous loot, was
invited to make his choice, the selected plunder to
be delivered at Wonosobo in consideration of five
guilders (a little over eight shillings). Many others
had the same experience: numberless statues and
stones carved into ornament have been appropriated
by official and unofficial visitors to enrich museums
and private collections. The appointment of
Wielandt Sr., later of Wielandt Jr. as keeper
of the <i>pasangrahan</i> and of the antiquities in a
region of archaeological interest equal to Pompeii
and Herculaneum, without any funds whatsoever at
their disposal, was only an incident in the continuous
farce performed by the Dutch East Indian
Government in all its relations to monumental Java
up to the date of its laborious confinement of the
Archaeological Commission&mdash;and after, as I shall
have abundant occasion to show: a farce with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
consequences sad to contemplate. This applies to
antiquities of every description. I turn to my
diary: In different places, when digging, layers of
ashes are found with charred human bones imbedded,
and often trinkets. The natives, however, keep
their treasure-troves secret for fear of the Government,
which has decreed, and rightly, reserving its
rights, that they may not sell without asking for
and obtaining permission, but appropriates everything
it hears of, at ridiculously low prices; a good
deal is therefore sold and bought privately, notwithstanding
the prohibition, even by officials; a
systematic search never having been attempted,
none the less fine trifles are unearthed and not
always trifles either; last night, in the <i>pasangrahan</i>,
some rings were shown to me; the owner, acting
very mysteriously, produced at last a statuette from
under his <i>baju</i>, about six inches of solid gold,
beautifully wrought; its mate, equal in height,
material and workmanship, he had been forced to
sell, according to his story, for seventy guilders
(less than £6); he wanted more to part with this
one and it is certainly worth many and many times
that sum; a change in the usual sordid Government
practice would result in remarkable discoveries;
recently, as Dr. L. told me, an inscribed stone was
laid bare; when trying to have a look at it the same
day, his informant told him that it had already been
spirited away to prevent <i>susah</i> (trouble); not much
is necessary to be sentenced to <i>krakal</i> (hard labour
in the chain-gang) at Wonosobo.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<p>It is true the Government sent some one to the
Diëng, about fifty years ago, to photograph the
temples as they then existed and, fortunately, the
operator chosen was I. van Kinsbergen who, having
made his début in Java as a member of an opera-troupe,
developed a rare artistic sense in portraying
the deteriorating outlines of the ancient fanes of
the island. But there the matter rested until the
complaints became too loud and in 1910 hopes
were held out that steps would be taken to clear
the ruins of parasitic vegetation, to drain the plateau
by repairing the trenches and conduits still in
working order since the Hindu period, incidentally
to consider the possibility of restoring the sanctuaries
not yet tumbled down. Names I heard in connection
with this charge, make me tremble, writes a
correspondent from Batavia, for a repetition of the
vandalism committed in the plain of Prambanan,
particularly the criminal assaults on the <i>chandi</i>
Plahosan and the <i>chandi</i> Sewu, where a Government
commissioner tried to arrest further decay on the
homoeopathic principle: <i>similia similibus curantur</i>.
Government solicitude for conservation proves often
more destructive than simple neglect and, to take
an illustration from the Diëng itself (others will
be culled in the course of my observations, from a
plentiful supply of official <i>bêtises</i> and <i>bévues</i>, if not
worse, in other localities), no sooner was general
attention drawn to the enigmatic sign, described by
Junghuhn and copied in his standard work from a
rock between the lakes Warna and Pengilon, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
it began to fade. Still quite clear in 1885 and up
to 1895, despite its having been exposed to wind
and weather during ten centuries (as surmised), it
became fainter and fainter after that year, the process
of a gradual loss of colour being duly noted at
subsequent visits, until in 1902 I found it hardly
distinguishable. To make up for the injury, a Contrôleur
discovered, in 1889, supplementary tokens,
not black but red, on the same Batu Tulis, or Watu
Ketèq as the natives rather call it, “monkey-stone”,
because they recognise in the figure recorded by
Junghuhn, a likeness to the animal referred to.
The smaller red letters, or whatever they were intended
for, steadily increasing in number, appearing
in places where I had never noticed anything before,
I could not help suspecting the little shepherds who
look so innocent and shy and hardly venture an
answer when spoken to, of knowing more about
this miraculous growth of a hieroglyphic inscription
than their artlessness implied. For all their stolid
mien, the natives are exceedingly fond of a joke and
what greater sport can be imagined than to get the
wise men of Batavia and of European centres of
erudition by the ears, inciting them to raise always
more learned dust in their efforts to decipher the
undecipherable characters of an impossible language,
each being cocksure of the infallibility of his individual
interpretation? If, however, we have not
to do with Kromo or Wongso his mark, the ghost
of the Batu Tulis must be held responsible for,
among the incorporeal inhabitants of the many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
caves in this neighbourhood, the dweller beneath
the monkey-stone is of greatest occult potency and
the good people who come from the adjoining lowland
districts, even from Surakarta and Jogjakarta,
to hear and translate the voices of the Diëng, repair
hither, after partaking of good advice in the Bimo
temple, to <i>sembah</i> (make their salutation) before the
entrance and ask <i>slamat</i> (blessing and success)
on their foreshadowed undertakings. Nocturnal
devotions inside the cave of the Watu Ketèq on a
lucky, right lucky, carefully calculated night, means
untold wealth, and whoever dares to brave the
resident sprite of darkness with that desire in his
heart, as very few do, and still remains a poor devil,
has doubtless skipped a word of power in muttering
his incantations or disregarded some other essential
observance.</p>

<p>To the lover of mountain scenery it is far more
profitable to wait for dawn near the triangulation
pillar and point of junction of four residencies:
Samarang, Pekalongan, Banyumas and the Bagelen,
with a fifth, the Kadu, only a few paces off, when
the Eye of Day rises to divide the waters behind the
mountains and the rack of clouds, and, to the north
and the south of the island, the sea begins to glimmer
in the azure and orange tints sent before to meet
the melting gray of vanquished darkness. Following
its course in all-compassing space, the soul enters
into silent communion with nature, the divine creation
of the supremely divine which teaches feeble men
how to worship. Such moments bring a wholesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
chastening of the flesh and as we descend, goaded
by the fierce darts of the conqueror overhead who
makes the earth wrap herself in her vapoury robe
of protection, veiling the grand vision,&mdash;as we
descend where the runnels descend that feed the
Serayu and the Tulis winding its way to the Kawah
Kidang, we find the plain with the <i>chandis</i> one
immense temple of adoration. The Vedic subtle
body yearns to enter the sheath of prayer, to be
moulded by its creator into the form fit for union
with the spirit of the world; respiration becomes
aspiration to the beatitude of manifest truth, of final
rest in extinction of sin and shame and sorrow. So
pass the hours in purification, in desire of a spark
of the thought which breathes life into mortification
of self. Then, at the passing of the light with the
last flush from the West, in awe-inspiring stillness,
the quivering stars lift their heads to watch the
holy city of the dead; in clear-toned stillness, the
night-wind moaning, the Rawa lamenting the lost
civilisation of a lost religion whose symbols remain
but are not understood, a mourning for humanity
labouring in vain. The Diëng has been repopulated
with a race between whose fanciful ideals, rooted in
a forgotten past, and the rapacity of foreign rulers
no lasting accord seems possible. Is it ordained
that they, the thralls and the masters, shall continue
in their present relations? Or will they disappear
in their turn and, to quote Junghuhn, this mountain
region revert to its free, natural state? Perhaps
in the hour of upheaval native seers prophesy, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
safety shall be found by none except to whom the
Just Reckoner grants it. And mingling in one
measure, which comprises the <i>jaman buda</i>, the time
of bondage and the future, their dim notions of
Mahadeva, the Beneficent Destroyer, and their
conception of the dispensation of the Book, the
leaders of religious exercise in the villages abide
by their advice of submission until the true believers
win the day, a day of glory for Islām, sure to arrive
in the circular course of existence, which is nothing
but Sansara, in attainment of Moslim brotherhood,
which is nothing but Brahma Vihara, the sublime
condition of love. Meanwhile, hearing is to be
practised; haply it will lead to the comprehension
of a lesson inculcated by each of the three creeds
amalgamated in the Javanese mind and best expressed
in the form borrowed from a fourth: The
thing that hath been, is that which shall be; and
that which is done, is that which shall be done,&mdash;or,
in the version of the greatest poet of our own age:

<p>The vast plain of Prambanan, which extends southward
from the foot of the Merapi, one of Java’s
most active volcanoes,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> is, or rather was, studded
with Sivaïte and Buddhist temples. Called, in the
later days of ignorance regarding their signification,
after some outstanding feature (Sewu, Loomboong,
Asu), after gods, demi-gods and heroes of romance
(as on the Diëng), after the villages near which they
were found (Kalasan or Kali Bening), or after
their general position, a good many might share the
appellation Prambanan. In speaking of <i>the</i> Prambanan
temples, however, the group is meant which
lies beside the main road between Surakarta and
Jogjakarta, where the two residencies meet, but still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
within the boundaries of the latter. Excepting the
Boro Budoor and Mendoot, it comprises the finest
and most famous monuments of Central Java, which
from olden times have been held in great veneration
by the population, even in their neglected condition,
when reduced to little more than heaps of overgrown
debris, lairs of wild animals. Freed from their
luxurious vegetation and excavated, architectural
remains of the first order came to light with
sculptured ornament nowhere else surpassed in
richness of detail and correctness of execution.
Surrounded by ruins of a mainly Buddhist character,
these buildings were consecrated to the Hindu
Trinity with Siva leading the Trimoorti as Bhatara
Guru, Master and Teacher of the World. A date
recently discovered, 886 Saka (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 964), or, according
to another reading, 996 Saka (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1074), points
to the period when Sivaïsm in Java had already
become strongly impregnated with Buddhism, a
circumstance fully borne out by the external
decoration.</p>

<div class="caption">IV. EAST FRONT OF THE SIVA (LORO JONGGRANG) TEMPLE OF THE PRAMBANAN GROUP IN 1895<br />(Cephas Sr.)</div>
</div>

<p>Among the natives, the Prambanan ruins go by
the name of <i>chandi</i> Loro<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Jonggrang because of the
legend connected with their origin. Once upon a
time Prambanan was ruled by a giant-king, Ratu
Boko, possessed of an only daughter, Princess Jonggrang,
and an adopted son, Raden Gupolo, whose
father had been killed by command of the King of
Pengging. Having sworn revenge, Raden Gupolo
feigned love for the beautiful daughter of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
monarch and asked Ratu Boko to assist him
in making her his wife. Ambassadors were despatched
with instructions to negotiate the marriage.
His Majesty of Pengging received them in a friendly
manner and entertained them at his Court but, not
wanting Raden Gupolo for a son-in-law, he sent
secret agents in all directions to seek and bind to his
service a hero with power to resist and subdue the
giants, Ratu Boko’s subjects, of whom he was in
mortal fear. One of those emissaries, searching the
slopes of the Soombing, met with the recluse Damar
Moyo of the children of Sumendi Petoong, the chief of
the <i>legèn</i>-drawers.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Damar Moyo’s wife had blessed
him with two sons, Bondowoso, a tall and strong
fellow, and Bambang Kandilaras, less muscular but
more favoured in outward appearance and of a
gentler disposition, whom he recommended as just
the man needed for the rescue of the Princess of
Pengging and ready for the task, provided her royal
father would consent, in consideration of the defeat
of the giants, to give his daughter to the young man
with half his kingdom as dowry and the other half
to follow after his death&mdash;which conditions prove
that even in those remote days the saintly did not
despise worldly advantage. The King of Pengging
consented and Bambang Kandilaras marched against
Prambanan, but no weapon could harm Ratu Boko,
who roared so dreadfully that the sound and his
breath combined were enough to knock any human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
foe down at a distance too far to distinguish a man
from a woman or a giant from a <i>waringin</i>-tree.
Bambang Kandilaras fled, reporting at Damar
Moyo’s cave, and was commanded to try once
more with the assistance of his brother Bondowoso.
They accomplished nothing. Bambang Kandilaras
ran away even before the battle commenced, to hide
himself in a ravine where the troops of Prambanan
could not follow him, and Bondowoso, blown off his
legs by a puff from Ratu Boko’s formidable lungs,
sought safety in precipitate retreat to the mountain
Soombing. Then Damar Moyo taught him a
magical word which, pronounced twice, would make
him big and heavy as an elephant, and give him
the strength of a thousand of those animals. Thus
armed, Bondowoso returned to Prambanan, where
he killed half of Ratu Boko’s warriors in their sleep,
while the other half, waking up, concentrated backward,
with the enemy in hot pursuit, to tell their king
what had happened. Nobody shall stir, said he; I
myself alone will settle this little business. Meeting
Bondowoso near the village Tangkisan,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> he began
to roar as loud and fume as hard as he could but,
to his astonishment, his breath lacked the accustomed
power and so he had to fight for his life hand to
hand. It was a terrible fight: houses and gardens
were trampled down, forests rooted up and
mountains kicked over, while the perspiration
dripping from the bodies of the enraged combatants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
formed a large pool, the Telaga Powiniyan.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> To
end the struggle, Bondowoso, in a supreme effort,
seized Ratu Boko round the middle and threw him
into that pool, where he sank and, drowning, made
the earth tremble with a last roar of anger and
distress.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Raden Gupolo, hearing the noise,
hastened to his assistance with a few drops of the
water of life in a cup, an elixir prepared by Mboq
Loro Jonggrang,&mdash;only a few drops, but enough to
resuscitate the dead giant-king if put to his lips.
Bambang Kandilaras, however, drew his bow and,
from the place where he had watched the fight,
shot the cup out of the hand of Raden Gupolo,
who thereupon attacked Bondowoso. Bambang
Kandilaras let more arrows fly at the giant-warriors
of Prambanan, who now rushed up to avenge their
king’s death. In the general <i>mêlée</i> Bondowoso
killed also Raden Gupolo and cut off his head,
which he threw away in an easterly direction,
changing it into a mountain, the Gunoong Gampeng;
but his brains and heart he threw away in a southwesterly
direction, changing them into another
mountain, the Gunoong Woongkal. Thereupon
he defeated the remaining half of the army of
Prambanan and repaired to Pengging, claiming the
reward for his brother. The king of that country,
glad to be rid of the giants, was as good as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
word, wedded his beautiful daughter to Bambang
Kandilaras and appointed Bondowoso his viceroy
in Prambanan, with the rank and title of <i>bupati</i>.
Taking up his abode in the palace of the late Raden
Gupolo, Bondowoso happened to see Mboq Loro
Jonggrang, who continued living in the <i>kraton</i> of
Ratu Boko, and fell in love with her. He asked
her hand in marriage and she, abhorring the man
who had killed her father, and one so unprepossessing
in countenance too, but afraid to provoke
his displeasure by a blank refusal, answered that she
was willing to become his wife on condition of his
providing a suitable <i>sasrahan</i> or wedding-present,
nothing more nor less than six deep wells in six
buildings, the like of which no mortal eye had ever
seen, with a thousand statues of the former kings of
Prambanan and their divine ancestors, the gods in
heaven, all to be dug and built and carved in one
night. Bondowoso called in the help of his father,
the recluse Damar Moyo, of the King of Pengging
and of his brother Bambang Kandilaras, all three
of whom responded, going to Prambanan and
uniting in prayer on the day before the night agreed
upon by the spirits of the lower regions, who had
been commandeered for the task by the saint of
the mountain Soombing. The evening fell and as
soon as darkness enveloped the earth a weird sound
was heard of invisible hands busy laying foundations,
erecting walls and sculpturing statuary. By half
past three o’clock the six wells were dug, the six
buildings completed and nine hundred and ninety-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>nine
statues standing in their places. But Mboq
Loro Jonggrang, roused from her slumbers by the
hammering and chiselling, and suspecting what was
going on, ordered her handmaidens out to stamp
the <i>padi</i><a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and to strew the ground, where the noise
was loudest, with flowers and to sprinkle perfume.
The spirits of the lower regions cannot bear the odour
of flowers and perfumes, as everybody knows; so
they had to desist and deserted their almost finished
work in precipitate flight, to the consternation of
Bondowoso, who pronounced this curse: Since the
girls of Prambanan take pleasure in fooling a faithful
suitor, may the gods grant that they shall have to
wait long before they become brides!<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Having said
this, yet hoping against hope, he called on his lady,
who asked tauntingly whether the honour of his
visit meant the announcement that the task imposed
upon him by way of testing his love, had been
completed. This filled the measure and he
answered: No, it is not and you shall complete it
yourself. The threat was immediately realised:
Loro Jonggrang changed into a statue of stone,
the thousandth, which terminated the labour of the
spirits and is still to be seen in a niche on the north
side of the principal edifice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The reader will recognise in this legend the
hoary eastern material of many others current also
in western lands. It pervades the legendary lore
connected with the plain of Prambanan in widest
sense, and one of its many variations, to be recorded
farther on, applies specially to the Buddhist <i>chandi</i>
Sewu or “thousand temples”, only a little distance
from the Loro Jonggrang group;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> in fact, originally
adapted to account for the many ruins scattered
over a vast area in that region, it has taken separate
forms to meet the requirements of separate localities.
Apart from tradition, we owe the oldest extant
description of the Prambanan antiquities to the East
India Company’s servant Lons at Samarang, who
wrote in 1733. The Governor-General van Imhoff
referred to them in 1746 and Raffles, his successor
during the British Interregnum, not satisfied with
writing and talking alone, commissioned Cornelius
with Wardenaar to survey them and make plans for
reconstruction. After 1816 things returned to the
accustomed neglect: A short stay in the plain of
Prambanan, says an authority already quoted,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> is
sufficient to note that thousands of valuable hewn
and sculptured stones have been and still are used
for all sorts of purposes ...; from time immemorial,
great quantities of stone have been (and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
still are) taken from Prambanan by his Highness
the Sooltan of Jogjakarta, generally once or twice a
year ...; this happens, if I am well informed, in
compliance with a written demand, fiated by the
local authorities. The foundation, in 1885, of the
Archaeological Society of Jogjakarta, which undertook
the excavation of the parts of the Loro
Jonggrang group covered with debris and vegetation,
and the clearing of the whole, did little to
ameliorate the situation with respect to the carrying
away from the Prambanan temples, speaking
collectively, of stones for the building of houses,
factories, etc., and of ornament for the decoration of
private grounds and gardens. Though bills were
posted all over the ruins, including Doorga’s, alias
Loro Jonggrang’s sanctum, prohibiting, by order of
that Society, the salving of gods and goddesses
with <i>boreh</i> and the defacing of the walls with
inscriptions, its members themselves dragged statues
away to fill a so-called museum of their contrivance
at the provincial capital, dislocating things of beauty,
ranging the <i>disjecta membra</i> on scaffoldings in a
shed as crockery on the shelves of a cupboard.
The monuments of Prambanan being primarily
mausolea, their first concern was to dig for the
<i>saptaratna</i>, the seven treasures buried with the
ashes of the dead under the images of the deities
hallowing those perishable remains. The plunder
consisted in urns containing, besides the ashes, coins,
rubies and other precious stones, pieces of gold- and
silver-leaf with cut figures (serpents, tortoises,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
flowers), strips of gold-foil inscribed with ancient
characters, fragments of copper and glass, etc. The
mortuary pits easiest to rifle, had already been
emptied before the semi-official spoilers turned their
attention to them. This chapter is not the most
glorious in the history of the Archaeological Society
of Jogjakarta which, on the other hand, started a
work too long neglected by the Dutch Government,
even after Raffles’ vigorous initial effort. Incidentally
it promoted the schemes of the superficial
yet very ambitious, pushing to the front on the
strength of what should have been put to the credit
of more capable but, to their detriment, more
modest labourers in the archaeological field: It is
not always the most deserving horses that get the
oats, says a Dutch proverb.</p>

<div class="caption">VI. SIVA (LORO JONGGRANG) TEMPLE OF THE PRAMBANAN GROUP IN 1901<br />(Cephas Sr.)</div>
</div>

<p>The Sivaïte character of the temples of Prambanan
would be sufficiently indicated, if there were
no other proofs, by the sepulchral cavities they
inclose and which define them as the monuments of
a graveyard consecrated to the memory of the great
and mighty of Hindu Mataram, who worshipped
Siva as Mahadeva, the Supreme God, Paramesvara,
the Maker, the Maintainer, the Marrer to make
again. Sepulchral pits or wells are, indeed, the
Sivaïte hall-mark in the architecture of Java and
here, at Prambanan, we find, in so far as preserved,
the finest of the edifices raised to encompass and
revet such pits, temple-tombs built for the glorification
of the Creator in creative consciousness, highest
boon granted to humanity, a glimmering of his All-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>Soul
which, leaving the dust to return to dust,
aspires to union with the Uncreated. A central
group of eight shrines, once surrounded by numberless
smaller ones, witnesses, in soberness of well-balanced
outline, in precision of detail, to the
exquisite art of those Hindu-Javanese master-builders
who, like the architects of our old
cathedrals, were unconcerned as to the opinion of
man, but had the adoration of the godhead in mind
and made the whole world partake of the divine
blessing which quickened heart and hand, whether
then descending from Siva’s nature as the essence
of the Trimoorti, or from the sublime truth symbolised
in the Christian Holy Trinity. The marvels
of design and execution still standing at Prambanan
in their dilapidated state, on a terrace excavated in
1893-4, were arranged, with the smaller ones now
altogether gone, in a square whose sides faced the
cardinal points. The material used in their construction
was a kind of trachyte which, originally
yellowish and hard to chisel into shape, has assumed
a dark gray colour and by the richness of the
sculptured ornament gives an impression as if
easily moulded like wax. The three western
temples, of which the one in the middle, consecrated
to Siva or, according to the natives, the <i>chandi</i>
Loro Jonggrang proper, is the largest, correspond
each with a smaller structure to the east; still
smaller <i>chandis</i> bound the space between the two
rows to the north and south. The buildings
dedicated to the Trimoorti, set squarely with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
square projection on each side, rest on basements of
the same polygonous conformation, so much in
favour with the architects of that period; the inner
rooms are on an elevated level because of their
position over the vault-like compartments saved out
in the substructures, and can be reached by staircases,
once provided with porches, leading to the
storeyed galleries. Vestiges of 157 diminutive
<i>chandis</i> outside the rampart which encircled the
central group, testify to the former existence of
many and many more, shut in by a second and a
third demolished wall. A closer inspection of the
ruins, revealing beauties not yet departed, leads to
an apprehension of what has been irrevocably lost.
These temples of the three gods who are but one,
always reminded me in their pathetic desolation of
the <i>capellas imparfeitas</i> of Santa Maria da Victoria;
what is incomplete, however, unfinished at Batalha,
has run to decay at Prambanan&mdash;there the budding
promise and arrested blossoming of an artistic idea,
here the scattered petals of the full-blown flower
rudely broken off its stem.</p>

<p>Siva is the keynote of the Prambanan group,
Siva, the Jagad, the Bhatara Guru, according to his
prevalent title in the island. In the temple which
bears his name, he appeared as the leader in the exterior
chapel looking south; his wife, Doorga, looks
north; their first-born, Ganesa, looks west. The
latter, sitting on his lotus cushion, is represented as
the Ekadanta, the elephant deprived of one of his
tusks when fighting Parashu Rama; a third eye in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
his forehead betokens his keenness of sight; he
wears in his crown the emblematic skull and crescent
of his father; one of his left hands brandishes his
father’s battle-axe; one of his right hands holds
the string of beads suggesting prayer; his father’s
<i>upawita</i>, the hooded snake, is strung round his
left shoulder and breast. Doorga, his mother, born
from the flames which proceeded from the mouths
of the gods, stands on the steer she killed when
the terrific animal had stormed Indra’s heaven and
humiliated the immortals; her eight hands<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> wield
the weapons and other gifts bestowed upon her by
the deities at their delivery: Vishnu’s discus, Surya’s
arrows, etc. etc., while her nethermost right hand
seizes the enemy’s tail and her nethermost left hand
the shaggy locks of the demon Maheso, who tries
to escape with the monster’s life. This magnificent
piece of sculpture, highly dramatic and yet within
the limits of plastic art, the unknown maker having
instinctively obeyed the rules formulated in Lessing’s
<i>Laokoon</i>, some thousand years after his labours were
ended, is the petrified Lady Jonggrang, victim of
Bondowoso’s revengeful love. It does not matter
to the native that Siva has always claimed her as
his consort, if not under the name of Doorga then
under that of Kali or Uma, ever since she, Parvati,
the Mother of Nature, divided herself into three
female entities to marry her three sons, who are none
but he who sits enthroned as Mahadeva in the inner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
chamber, looking east, with his less placid personifications,
the <i>dvarapalas</i> (doorkeepers) Nandisvara
and Mahakala, the wielders of trident and cudgel,
guarding the entrance, supported by demi-gods and
heroes. The colossal statue of their heavenly lord,
broken into pieces by the falling roof, has been
restored and replaced on its <i>padmasana</i> (lotus
cushion). In this shape the god wears the <i>makuta</i>
(crown) with skull and crescent, has a third eye in his
forehead and a cobra strung round his left shoulder
and breast; his body, decked with a tiger’s skin, rests
against the <i>prabha</i>, his aureole; one of his left
hands holds his fly-flap, one of his right hands
his string of beads; of his trident only the stick
remains.</p>

<p>Siva, the one of dreadful charm, is everywhere,
either personified or in his attributes: he dominates
the external decoration of the Vishnu and the
Brahma temples too, in the latter case as <i>guru</i>, even
to the exclusion of all other gods; the middle <i>chandi</i>
of the eastern row, facing his principal shrine, has
his <i>vahana</i>, the bull; the one to the north his smaller
image, while in the third, to the south, wholly
demolished, no statuary can be traced. The inner
chambers of the subordinate buildings show more
plainly than that of Siva, which is adorned with
flowery ornament, that the Sivaïte style concentrated
ornamentation rather on the exterior than on
the interior. The four statues of Brahma, the master
of the four crowned countenances, who lies shattered
among the debris of his temple, and the four statues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of Vishnu in his (a large one with <i>makuta</i>, <i>prabha</i>,
<i>chakra</i> and <i>sanka</i>, and three smaller ones, representing
him in his fourth and fifth <i>avatar</i> and in his
married state with his <i>sakti</i> Lakshmi in miniature
on his left arm), are chastely conceived in the chaste
surroundings of their chapels. In addition to the
sorely damaged <i>Ramayana</i> reliefs, presently to be
spoken of, they dwell, however simple the interior
arrangement of their cells may be, among richly
carved images of their peers and followers stationed
outside: Vishnu among his own less famous <i>avatars</i>
and supposed Bodhisatvas between female figures;
Brahma, as already remarked, among personifications
of the ubiquitous Siva in his quality of teacher,
accompanied by bearded men of holiness. Siva’s
<i>nandi</i>, a beautifully moulded humped bull, emblem
of divine virility, watches his master’s abode, attentive
to the word of command,&mdash;watches day and night
as symbolised by Surya, the beaming sun, carrying
the flowers of life when rising behind her seven
horses, and by Chandra, the three-eyed moon, drawn
by ten horses, waving a banner and also presenting
a flower, but one wrapped in a cloud. The <i>chandis</i>
of the eastern row, fortunately not yet despoiled of
these striking specimens of Sivaïte sculpture, the
statue of Siva opposite the Vishnu temple and
enough to enable one to recognise that they too had
once a band of ornament in high and low relief,
emphasise even in the ruinous condition of their
substructures, polygonous like those of the larger
temples but on square foundations, the mystery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
attaching to the fascination exercised by the main
building they supplement, and whose decoration,
strictly Sivaïtic on the inside while partaking of the
Buddhistic on the outside, has racked many brains
for an explanation. The bo-trees and prayer-bells,
profusely employed in its external embellishment,
together with figures agreeable to the Bodhisatva
theory, have led some to advance the opinion that it
is a purely Buddhist creation, though perhaps tinged
with Sivaïte notions. They were met with the
objection that there is no sign of a dagob as distinguishing
Buddhist feature; that the riddle of the
resemblance between the statuary on the outside
of the Siva temple and the conventional representation
of Bodhisatvas, could find its solution in the
canonisation or deification of kings and famous
chiefs, a practice as old as ancestor-worship, which
held its own in Java from pre-Hindu days up to our
own. However this may be, if the Prambanan
temples, and especially the one particularly dedicated
to the great god of the Trimoorti, preached orthodox
Sivaïsm to the elect of its innermost conviction,
while tainted externally with the heresy of the
deniers of the existence of gods, the indubitably
Buddhist Mendoot reverses the process. This and
the syncretism discernible in nearly all the <i>chandis</i>
of Java, shows the religious tolerance of the Javanese
in the Hindu period. And religiously tolerant they
are still as true believers in the true faith of
Islām; the fanaticism one occasionally hears of,
roots rather in discontent from economic causes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
than in bigotry or over-zealous devotion to a creed
which declares rebellion for conscience’ sake against
a firmly established rule that recognises it, to be
unlawful.</p>

<p>The demi-gods and heroes with their followers
on the outside of the Siva temple, occupy, counting
from the base upward, the third tier of ornamentation,
also the highest in the roofless condition of the
building: the few niches left above are empty.
Beneath, the story of Rama, an incarnation of
Vishnu, is told in bas-reliefs which belong to the
very best Hindu sculpture discovered in Java or
anywhere else. The division of the casements is
effected by bo-trees, sitting lions and standing or
dancing women in haut-relief, especially the last
being of exquisite workmanship. In endlessly varying
attitudes, embracing one another or tripping the
light fantastic toe, retreating and advancing, their
measured steps being regulated by the musicians on
interspersed panels, they represent the <i>apsaras</i>,
nymphs of heaven, adorning the house of prayer
to acquaint mortal man with the joys in store for the
doer of good. The human birds and other mythical
animals under the bo-trees, the prayer-bells and
flowers in the garlanded foliage, enhance the charm
of this ingenious decoration, the splendidly limbed
virgins disporting themselves in a frame of imposing
magnificence, their graceful movements being
worthily seconded by the sumptuous setting. Nor
does this wealth of detail, this marvellous display
of artistic power, of skill perfected by imaginative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
thought, divert the attention from the divine idea
embodied in Siva or from the introduction to its
understanding provided by the <i>Ramayana</i>, initiating
the beholder’s intelligence by degrees. All is so
well balanced that the lower guides to the higher
in whetting comprehensive desire. First, on reaching
the terrace, starting from the low level of vulgar
interest, curiosity and sympathy are awakened by
the epic which shared popular favour with the
<i>Brata Yuda</i>. It is not known who enriched the
literature of Java with a version of the <i>Ramayana</i>
adapted to Javanese requirements; as in the case
of the <i>Mahabharata</i> he was probably one of the
poets living at the cultured courts of the eastern
part of the island. Whatever his name, he made a
hit with his tale of the god who descended from
heaven, bent on flirting with the daughters of
men, and won a wife, the tenderly loving Sita, by
drawing Dhanusha, the mighty bow of Siva. His
success may be appraised by the circumstance that
scenes taken from his poem were deemed suitable
to embellish the tombs of sovereign rulers. Can
it be called an improvement after more than a
thousand years of progressive western civilisation
that we, to honour the memory of our dead, make
shift with inflated epitaphs advertising virtues in
life often conspicuous by an absence which the
maudlin angels of our cemeteries, rather than
shedding undeserved, vicarious tears, perpetually
seem to bemoan on their own account?</p>

told from the moment of Dasharatha, King of
Ayodhya, invoking his aid to make the royal
consorts partake of the blessing of motherhood.
Vishnu, resting on the seven-headed serpent of
the sea, Sesha or Ananta, the one without end,
dispenses a potion which makes Kantalya, who
drinks half of it, conceive Rama; Kaykaji, who
drinks a fourth part of it, Bharata; and the third
spouse, who drinks the rest, the twins Lakshmana
and Shatrughna. We can follow Vishnu, reborn
from mortal woman, on the reliefs of the Siva
temple, which are tolerably preserved, through the
first stages of his earthly career as Rama, but must
renounce studying his subsequent story on the
exterior of the temples dedicated to himself and
Brahma, where the third tier of sculpture has
altogether disappeared, save a few mutilated bas-reliefs.
That is a great pity, for the illustration
of the <i>Ramayana</i> by the artists entrusted with the
decoration of the <i>chandi</i> Prambanan, judging from
what we still possess, marks the apogee of Hindu-Javanese
art; revelling in accessory ornament, it
never surfeits, keeping the leading idea well in
view, every embellishment adding to its intrinsic
value. The heavy moulding above the lowest band
of chiselled work of the Siva temple has fortunately
protected it from being damaged by falling stones;
here we are able to discover the sculptor’s technique
at close quarters and it is worthy of note that some
of the curly lions are wanting in their appointed
places. This, coupled with the fact that a few of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the <i>apsaras</i> remained unfinished, while others, like
statues of gods on higher planes, have only been
outlined, and spaces, evidently contrived for
ornament, present flat surfaces, has led to the
conjecture of a catastrophe which surprised the
builders and made them suspend their labours as
in the case of the Bimo temple of the Diëng
plateau.</p>

<p>One of the salient features of the decoration at
Prambanan, indeed of all ancient Javanese art,
Sivaïte and Buddhist, is the representation of
animal life as an important factor in human destiny.
If the Buddha was called the Sakya Sinha, the Lion
of the Sakyas, and his sylvan embodiment adorns in
many reproductions the Boro Budoor, his stateliest
temple, at Sivaïte Prambanan we find the king of
the desert extensively utilised in the general decoration,
together with the beasts of the field under the
bo-trees and fanciful combinations of man and his
lowly friends, not dumb but of different speech, like
the <i>kinnaris</i>, the bird-people. The <i>Ramayana</i> bas-reliefs
echo the kindness<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> shown to those humble
companions in Indian myth, history and present-day
asylums for the aged and infirm among them.
Attending the monkey warriors with whose help the
simian deity Hanoman restored King Sugriva to
the throne of his forefathers at Kishkindhya (an
allusion, it is thought, to the doughty deeds of the
aborigines of the Deccan), <i>bajings</i><a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and <i>bolooks</i><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
gambolling round the house of the Most Awful
and Mysterious, once worshipped here by great
nations whose very names are lost, but whose art,
giving a place to all creation in symbolic expression
of the divine, still teaches us the lesson that the
animals are also children of the gods, endowed with
life not to be exterminated to serve our pleasure
and our vanity, or to be abused for our profit, but
to enjoy the fullness of the earth and the good gifts
of heaven as we do ourselves, or might do if we
were wise. Mother Nature, Siva’s <i>sakti</i> Doorga,
nurses at her bosom all her husband’s offspring,
without distinction, and at Prambanan she superintends
the growing world, as the mistress of his
household, in the highly finished form the artist has
given her: Loro Jonggrang, daughter of Ratu Boko
of the Javanese legend. Not in her outward
character of the demon-steer subduing virago does
she attract her worshippers here, nor in that of the
woman of the golden skin riding the tiger, full of
menace, but in that of Uma, the gentle goddess
who sheds light on perplexing problems of conduct,
to whom one turns in distress. Ideal of high-born
loveliness, Loro Jonggrang is especially venerated
by those of her own sex who are in trouble or have
a desire to propound in the fumes of incense they
burn: barren matrons praying for issue from their
bodies to their lords and masters, like the wives of
King Dasharatha; virgins anxious to get married;
pseudo-virgins who have trusted too much in the
promises of their lovers, following the <i>hadat</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
established by herself at Prambanan and diligently
observed (not only, it should be noticed, in that
neighbourhood, but likewise where no one ever
heard of Loro Jonggrang and her <i>escapades
d’amour</i>), insisting that, in the name of the precedent
she set, consequences shall be warded off.
When <i>pasar</i>, <i>i.e.</i> market, falls on a Friday,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> her
votaries are exceptionally numerous, mostly native
women entreating deliverance from female ills or
help in the attainment of feminine wishes. Chinese,
half-caste and occasionally European ladies may,
however, be observed among them: it is said that
several happy mothers of the ruling race at
Jogjakarta and Surakarta owe their husbands
and children to Notre Dame de Bon Secours of
Prambanan; that brides having obtained their
heart’s desire in union with the beloved, the
bridegrooms in their turn repair to her shrine,
after a honeymoon ended in storm-clouds, with an
earnest supplication for means of release. This
explains the sprinkling of males among the fair
devotees on Fridays, dejected looking persons who
smear the statue of Doorga with <i>boreh</i>, despite
notices to desist, supplicating her to repeal former
decrees, having different objects in view, of course,
with their salvings of Ganesa and Siva’s <i>nandi</i>.
Favours are requested, pledges are given, votive
sacrifices are performed, the gods and their attributes,
Mboq Loro Jonggrang in the first place, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
wreathed and festooned with flowers in compliance
with an old Hindu custom so deeply rooted that
we may notice grave, turbaned <i>hajis</i> yielding to it,
unheedful of the Prophet’s anathemas against those
who commit the unpardonable sin of idolatry, straying
more widely from the right path than the
brute cattle, wicked doers, companions of hell-fire
whose everlasting couch shall be on burning
coals.</p>

<p>As the exhalations of the incense rise to the
dying rays of the sun and mix with the scent of the
<i>kembangan telon</i>, the flowers of sacrifice, <i>melati</i>,
<i>kananga</i> and <i>kantil</i>, the soughing of the trees in the
evening breeze repeats the lessons taught by an
ancient inscription found near the temples of
Prambanan, and a summary of which Hindu-Javanese
<i>Libro del Principe</i>, taken from a translation
by a Panambahan of Sumanap, may be acceptable:
What has been here set down, was in the
beginning an ancestral tradition, very useful if
observed, but, if disregarded, it becomes a curse.
This inscription was made in the year 396 (?), in
the third month, on a Friday in the sixth era. Let
it inform you of the most exalted, of the road
to enlightenment and happiness, to attain your
country’s progress and prosperity. Proof thereof
will be cheap food and raiment, and universal peace,
that those who honour the gods may lead tranquil
lives. Honouring the gods is the perfection of
conduct. Whosoever strives after that will be
smiled upon by them, for the practising of virtue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
provides access to heaven, which shines in splendour,
and all gods will unite with the supreme Siva
Bathara Indra to assist the practiser of virtue. But
whosoever does wrong will go to perdition and his
appearance will be monstrous, his shape like the
shape of a dog; such a one acts unwisely because
he turns away from virtue and obeys his passions,
which are his enemies. It seems good to know
this in life, in order to practise virtue and praise the
godhead, believing in Bhatara, who has power over
the world, possessing heaven and earth. The
teachers must also be respected, without exception,
because of their venerable charge, and you must
learn of them to honour Bathara above all gods,
the Omnipotent, the Ruler and Maintainer of everything.
Praise him in order that you may gain
happiness and bliss even while you live on earth.
Honour your parents and the parents of your
parents and their teachings, which are inviolable, as
they before you considered inviolable the teachings
which came to them from their parents and
ancestors as received from the god Bathara, who
opened their hearts to probity. Know that they
were allowed to adorn themselves with fragrant
flower-buds wherever their influence penetrated:
this will also be your privilege after the purification
of your minds. Conduct yourselves honestly
according to divine direction, acquire discretion and
try to resemble the illustrious kings of the past who
compassed the felicity of their subjects. Be no regarders
of persons either among the good or among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the bad; all are mortals in a fleeting world. This
consider: Bathara is the King of Kings who ordains
the holy institutions. Fill the place of a father
among his children. If there are any of your subjects
who act wickedly, command them to mend their ways;
if they persist in evil, teach them to distinguish
between what is good and what is bad in their souls,
to the advantage of the living. Excellent men must
be appointed to manage the affairs of the people.
These three things are of highest importance: that
proper instruction be given; that your subjects
become prosperous instead of poor through oppression;
that every one of them know the boundaries of
his fields. Persevere in honouring Bathara! Glorify
him and inherit joy! Dress cleanly and keep your
bodies clean. Acknowledge the omnipotence of
Bathara Giri Nata and, protected by him, no one
can harm you. May his superiority be reflected in
you to confound the wicked doers. If you desire a
change of station, seek seclusion to do penance in
order that Bathara’s brilliancy may become visible
in you. Nothing is so beautiful and so profitable
to you as the conquest of your passions, subduing
them to a pure mind and lofty aspirations, vanquishing
the enemies of virtue who reveal themselves: it
will help to proclaim your lustrous righteousness.
Glorify Bathara! He will descend in his beneficence
to show you the way. Reflect seriously:
some day you must die; ponder over the mystery
of life and make the ignorant understand for their
own salvation. Behaving in this manner, happiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
cannot escape you, kings of good rule, all of whose
prayers will be listened to and with whom no one
can be compared: this is the sign of the eminence
of the sovereign who dominates men as the tiger
dominates whatever breathes in the forest. The
gods will protect such kings to the benefit of their
subjects, traders and carriers of merchandise and
labourers in the fields. Nothing is denied to the
obedient, for the gods ward off evil from their
thrones; evil is known in heaven before it touches
the mortals on earth. Glorify Bathara! The men
of rank and high birth who serve kings, must be
of middle age. In their fiftieth year it behoves
them to retire from the world into prayerful solitude
to die as a child dies; let the body suffer for
the soul, crowning the end of life. As you grow in
knowledge your wishes will be fulfilled and your
soul will leave its prison. The token of higher
knowledge is evident. Where does the soul go?
It gains in beatitude or, if no progress has been
made, it seeks a refuge in the bodies of animals and
people of mean appetites. Gaining in beatitude,
it reaches heaven, the garden of rest, but hell is the
abode of sin. Cleanse, therefore, your thoughts;
eschew impurity! Do not favour the wealthy, nor
despise the poor; all are equally confided to your
care. O ye, who are kings and represent the gods
in your kingdoms, listen to this admonition and
know your responsibility for the ultimate lot of your
subjects. Bathara, the lord of life and death, will
call you to account. Woman has been created<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
inferior to man; but many men are enticed to
wrong-doing by the smooth speech of their women-folk,
who lack perception by the inscrutable decree
of the gods. Woman wishes to control man, taking
her caprice for wisdom, always pressing him to
follow her fancies. The chronicles, however,
mention the names of queens like Sri Chitra Wati,
Sinta Devi and Sakjrevati Drupadi. In the days
of Dhipara Jaga, Tirta Jaga, Karta Jaga and Sang
Ngara bloody wars devastated the land; kings
were bewitched and changed into dragons and
elephants because they disregarded the ordinances
of Bathara and also because they were weak, not
able to restrain their burning passion for beautiful
women, acting differently from that which behoves
those in authority. Possess your souls in continence!
Bathara watches and you are unacquainted
with the hour of your death.</p>

<p>The shadows of evening thicken; darkness
gathers, darkness in the train of Rahu, the devourer
of sun and moon, robing the temples in gloom.
Fire-flies, darting from between the sculptured bo-trees
and festooned foliage, begin to hold their
nocturnal feast but subside before a red glare,
nascent in the holy of holies. They return, as if
borne by strange, wild melodies, and grow into the
luxurious forms of luminous nymphs, the <i>apsaras</i>,
who leave their stations round the house of fear to
dance their voluptuous dance of death, renouncing
their allegiance to the Mahadeva to court Kama of
the flowery bow, consumed by the desire to enjoy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
life and life’s best before the approach of the mower
cutting them down. Their mates, the <i>gandharvas</i>,
excite them in their weird revelry with songs and
the musicians urge them with the clang of tabors
and cymbals. Shaped for the enchanting arts of
love, skilled in the wiles of female magic, they move
in a whirl of passion, like flames of fire, more
redoubtable to man than the sword and arrows of
his bitterest foe. Luring the unwary who tarry at
Prambanan when the fates, weaving the web of the
world, change the colours of day into night’s
blackest dyes, when the lotus-blossoms hang heavy
on their stems and the air is burdened with the
odour of incense and sacrificial wreaths, they intend
his subversion by a mirage of delight, a hallucination
of the senses, and present the gratification of
carnal desire as the triumph of reason. Woe to
him if he does not resist in the delirium of his
infatuation! The moment he tries to grasp their
flitting forms, they evade him as a mountain stream
in spate, as the spray of its water dashing down the
rocks, as foam on the surging brine. The <i>apsaras</i>
mock, the <i>gandharvas</i> hiss him, the musicians howl,
all turning again to stone, having instilled their
subtle poison into his heart. He seeks in vain the
joy they held out to him, begs in vain for a draught
of the <i>soma</i>, the nectar of the gods. Then, shooting
out from the great god’s abode as a flash of lightning,
the red glare takes substance and Siva appears
in his most terrible aspect, Kala, destroying time,
waving the skull which springs from the lotus stem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
menacing men and cattle, the wild beasts of the
woods, the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea,
with the <i>trishula</i>, the trident of desolation. Behind
him the Devi, his spouse, emerges from her niche,
riding Vayu, the stormwind, not Doorga or Uma
disguised as Loro Jonggrang, but Kali, the furious,
of hideous countenance, crowned with snakes,
dripping with blood. Lifting up her voice above
the roaring of her steed, she joins the Dread One,
Rudra, the Thunderer, and passion and baffled
desire become a portion of the tempest she raises,
the odour of the <i>kembangan telon</i> breathing agony.
Mahakala, the Almighty Overthrower, deals death
under his veil. But if the night of terror begins in
darkness, it will end in dawn and light of day: all
that lives, is born to die for new life to succeed, and
so teaches Siva himself, the Bhatara Guru. In
adoration of Ganesa, the fruit of his union with
Parvati, wisdom will accrue to him who learns the
lesson; enlightenment from the spectacle of time, the
demolisher, fortifying fecund nature, reanimating
the universe in anguish of decay. Wisdom is the
great gift, purification of the soul in abstinence
from the pleasures which drag it down, to keep the
spark of the divine undefiled in its earthly sheath with
the aid of the father and the son, whose distinctive
qualities merge in Wighnesa, the vanquisher of
obstacles. Drinking their essence, man’s hearing
and knowing leads to affection and commiseration,
to the second Brahma Vihara, the sublime condition
of sorrow at the sorrow of others, and when dissolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
arrives as a reward, Yama, the judge of the dead,
will find no cause for reproach. The good will
enter the diamond gate, but grievous torment awaits
the foolish who pamper the flesh and are ensnared
by the daughters of lust.</p>

CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="small">MORE OF CENTRAL JAVA</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Le bon sens nous dit que les choses de la terre n’existent que bien
peu et que la vraie réalité est dans les rêves. <span class="smcap">Charles Baudelaire</span>,
<i>Les Paradis Artificiels (Dédication)</i>.</p></div>


<p>Except during a period of some four centuries and
a half, from about 940 till the palmy days of
Mojopahit, when declining Hindu civilisation, for
reasons as yet unexplained, sought a refuge farther
east, Central Java and especially that part of it
known in our time as the Principalities, <i>i.e.</i> Surakarta
and Jogjakarta, has always been the heart of
the island. There lived and live the true Javanese,
the people of heaven’s mercy, cherishing their old
traditions; these and the beautiful scenery of their
fire-mountains and fertile valleys are still theirs,
whatever else may fail: glory, power and freedom.
They lived and live in their world of custom and
formality a life unintelligible in its inner workings
to the western brain, impenetrable to the western
eye. There are forces hidden in the Javanese
mind, the resultant of a strangely moved past,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
which we can never understand, though we may
admire their creative energy, revealed in the now
conventional designs guiding the hand of the potter,
the wood-carver, the goldsmith, the armourer, the
<i>batikker</i>,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> hereditary practisers of dying arts and
crafts; in the remains of a marvellous architecture
long since altogether dead. No chapter in the
whole history of eastern art, says Fergusson, is so
full of apparent anomalies or upsets so completely
our preconceived ideas of things as they ought to
be, as that which treats of the architectural history
of the island of Java ...; the one country to which
they (the Hindus) overflowed, was Java, and there
they colonised to such an extent as for nearly a
thousand years to obliterate the native arts and
civilisation and supplant it by their own ...; what
is still more singular is, that it was not from
the nearest shores of India that these emigrants
departed but from the western coast.... A <i>linga</i>,
erected in the Kadu in the year 654 Saka (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 732),
a Sivaïte symbol of generation, marks the origin of
an artistic activity whose most brilliant period, the
classical one of central Javanese architecture, as
G. P. Rouffaer styles it rightly, begins with the
construction of such buildings as the Buddhist
<i>chandi</i> Kalasan or Kali Bening. The inscription of
King Sanjaya in Venggi characters, and vestiges of
Vaishnav tendencies in the Suku and Cheto temples
of a much later date, point to the worship of Vishnu,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
while Brahma’s four sublime conditions and more
subtle transcendentalism do not seem to have
attracted the Javanese converts to Hinduïsm.
They could grasp the unity of Siva’s threefold
functions much better and accepted him as Mahadeva
at the head of the Trimoorti. The advent of
Buddhism in its <i>mahayanistic</i> form, the creed of the
northern church so called, served to emphasise
native tolerance. Sivaïsm and whatever there was
of Vishnuïsm, harmonised with Buddhism to the
extent of borrowing and lending symbols, emblems
and divine attributes; Hindu gods played puss in
the corner with Bodhisatvas, as already remarked
upon in the preceding chapter; the <i>chandi</i> Chupuwatu
surprises us with a <i>stupa-linga</i>;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> a Javanese
prince of the thirteenth century bears the expressive
name of Siva-Buddha; the old Javanese <i>Sang
Hiang Kamahayanikan</i> contains the dictum: Siva
is identical with Buddha.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> If more inscriptions had
been found, more light might have been thrown on
the anomalous ornamentation of, for instance, the
Prambanan temples and the Mendoot; but Sivaïte
records of the kind leaving the matter unexplained,
Buddhist information is still scantier, perhaps a
consequence of Baghavat’s followers not excelling
in epigraphy or literary labours of any description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>If the backwash of great political events or
religious discussion when the Islām superseded
older creeds, may have aided Kala, the Destroyer,
in demolishing a good many buildings of the
classical period, whose sites even are sought in
vain, it is certain that the pioneers of western
civilisation, proud of their superiority, willfully and
wantonly undid in many places work that had
been spared by time and earthquakes and volcanic
eruptions and enemies born of the soil, devastating
with fire and sword their brethren’s hearths and
houses. Christian zealots regarded the ancient
monuments as assembly-rooms of the Devil where
the benighted heathen used to foregather in idolatry,
lodges of abomination the sooner razed the better,
a pious feeling often translated into action on
grounds of utility: the stones offered excellent
building material. Officials and <i>particulieren</i><a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> of
broader views, besides acknowledging the serviceableness
of <i>chandis</i> in this respect, went <i>recho</i>-hunting<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
for the adornment of their houses and
gardens. Quite a collection has been formed in the
residency grounds at Jogjakarta, the nucleus of
which was moved thither from the estate Tanjong
Tirta, whose former occupants, like most of the
landed gentry, made exceedingly free with the
temples and monasteries in that neighbourhood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
As neither they nor the others bothered about
noting where they got this or that piece of sculpture,
we are entirely at sea concerning the meaning of
several beautiful statues. This is the case, <i>e.g.</i>,
with one of remarkably fine execution, a crowned
goddess, sitting on a lotus cushion and encircled by
a flaming aureole, pressing her hands to her bosom.
She has been fortunate enough to escape the fate
of some deities who shared her sequestration and
were left to the care of the convicts detailed to keep
the Resident’s compound in trim, a duty performed
by whitewashing or daubing them with a grayish
substance, excepting the hair of the head, the eyebrows,
the eyeballs and the <i>prabha</i>, which the
gentlemen-artists of the chain-gang are in the habit
of painting black, enhancing the general effect by
“restoring” lost hands and feet and damaged faces
after methods nothing short of barbarous, but therefore
the better in keeping with the traditional attitude
of those in authority. For this infamous disfiguration
and desecration, which makes any one
unaccustomed to Dutch East Indian processes
shudder with horror, never disturbed the aesthetic
sense or equanimity of the several occupants of the
residency who, during the last thirty-five years, saw
it going on under their very eyes, the eyes of the
representatives of a Government lavish in circulars<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
recommending the country’s antiquities to their
care. Neither are those eyes shocked by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
“museum” adjoining the residency, a jumble of
plunder from <i>chandis</i> far and near; nor by the
chaotic mass of torsos, arms and legs, fragmentary
evidence of wholesale spoliation behind that pitiful
exhibition of archaeology turned topsyturvy.</p>

<p>So much for the statuary removed from the
<i>chandis</i>, as far as it can be traced. Concerning the
<i>chandis</i> themselves, it should be remembered that
the greater part has wholly disappeared. Hillocks,
overspread with brushwood, sometimes awaken hopes
that by digging foundations and portions of walls may
be discovered; heaps of debris, tenanted by lizards
and snakes, point to structures of which nothing
that is left, indicates the former use; shattered
ornamental stones speak of magnificent buildings
fallen or pulled down&mdash;glimmerings of splendour
that was. The temples still standing are reduced
to ruins and diminish almost visibly in attractiveness
and size. Rouffaer<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> gave an interesting example
of their fate in the story of the spiriting
away of the <i>chandi</i> Darawati: in 1889 tolerably
well preserved, though two large statues of the
Buddha had been dragged off to the dwelling of a
European in the <i>dessa</i> Gedaren, it was gone in 1894&mdash;vanished
into air! The temples constructed of
brick, like the <i>chandi</i> Abang, have suffered even
more, of course, than those of stone, the memory of
whose grandeur is retained in a few ghastly wrecks.
Reserving the Buddhist remains for later treatment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and passing by the Sivaïte caves with rectangular
porches in the Bagelen, mentioned by Fergusson,
I shall deal here with the <i>chandis</i> Suku and Cheto,
and the most noteworthy ruins in the southern
mountains. The latter comprise the <i>kraton</i> of Ratu
Boko, Mboq Loro Jonggrang’s father, as the natives
call it, and the temple group of the Gunoong Ijo.
Of the legendary kingly residence little more is left
than a square terrace with portions of a wall and
the sill of a gate. The <i>chandi</i> Ijo consists of a
large temple of the usual polygonal form with ten
smaller ones and a pit which contained two stone
receptacles and strips of gold-leaf with the image
of a deity and an inscription; the buildings are in
a sad condition, but decay has not impaired their
beauteous dignity and the landscape alone repays
a visit to Soro Gedoog, an estate whose gradual
reclamation of the jungle led to their discovery in
1886 when ground was cleared for an extension of
the plantations.</p>

<p>The <i>chandis</i> Suku and Cheto are situated
respectively on the western and northern slope of
the Gunoong Lawu, a volcano on the boundary
between Surakarta and Madioon, not less expressive
in its scenery of what heaven has done for this
delicious island. Shortly after the mysterious
pyramids of Suku had drawn the attention of
Resident Johnson, in the British Interregnum,
Thomas Horsfield visited them and made some
drawings. The inscriptions and the sculptured
ornament of Cheto were reported upon by C. J.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
van der Vlis, in 1842. The groups belong to the
latest, most decadent period of Hindu architecture
in Java and their foundation, Suku being a few
years older than Cheto, must have coincided with
the introduction of the Islām. Bondowoso, the son
of the recluse Damar Moyo, who assisted the King of
Pengging against Ratu Boko and took such signal
revenge upon the latter’s daughter, Loro Jonggrang,
for rejecting him, the uncouth slayer of her father,
is supposed to have erected the buildings at Suku.
Those at Cheto owe their origin to a prince of
Mojopahit, who quarrelled with his brother, the
ruler of that empire, or, according to another
legend, to a certain Kiahi Patiro, who refused to
become a convert to the new faith and repaired to
the Lawu, where he lived as a hermit and was killed
by Pragiwongso, an emissary of the Moslim King
of Demak. <i>Linga</i>-worship returned in the temple
groups of the Lawu to its crudest modes of expression,
and Fergusson, who mentions the dates 1435
and 1440, speaks of a degraded form of the Vishnuïte
religion, the <i>garuda</i>,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> the boar, the tortoise, etc.,
being of frequent occurrence in the ornamentation.
Junghuhn described the staircases he found, which
connected the terraces, and the statues, which hardly
came up to the artistic standard of Prambanan and
the Boro Budoor, one of them distinguishing itself
by a colossal head whose measurement from chin
to crown was three feet, half of the whole height.
Comparing his description with the actual state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
things, much must have been removed, heaven
knows whither! Notwithstanding the obvious truth
of Fergusson’s remark that a proper illustration of
Suku and Cheto, and, I may be permitted to add,
of the remains on the summit of the mountain,
whether originally tree-temples or consecrated to
devotional exercises in the open, <i>à l’instar</i> of West
Java, promises to be of great importance to the
history of architecture in the island, very little has
been done in that direction or even for the conservation
of the ruins where <i>recho</i>-hunters and a luxurious
vegetation vie in obliterating the traces of most
interesting antiquities. Junghuhn sounded a note
of warning apropos of the falling in of the peculiarly
constructed pyramidal temple, May 1838, but this
and the other monuments have been suffered since,
as before, to crumble quietly away and the easily
removable sculpture to be carried off. Ganesa, in
his manifold reproductions, seconds on the Lawu
his father Siva, head of the Trimoorti, continuing
the lead obtained seven centuries earlier in the
plain of Prambanan, and a systematic study of the
reliefs, now covered with moss and lichens, might
shed a good deal of light on several unsettled
questions. One of those reliefs, blending the human
and the divine in the manner of the allusions to the
<i>Brata Yuda</i> on the Diëng plateau and the Rama
legend on the walls of the <i>chandi</i> Loro Jonggrang,
represents a complete armoury, with Ganesa, protector
of arts and crafts, between the armourer
himself and his assistant who works the bellows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
If, with Rouffaer, we divide the long era during
which the Hindus, first as immigrants and then as
rulers, merged gradually in the aboriginal population,
into a Hindu-Javanese period of Central Java
and a Javanese-Hindu period of East Java, the
monuments of Suku and Cheto belong evidently
to the epoch of Javanese-Hindu decline, decadent
art flowing back to its classical source, tarnishing
original Hindu-Javanese conceptions. Leaving
Buddhist architecture to be dealt with in the last
chapters, and before turning to the <i>chandis</i> of East
Java, a short historical review may aid in the
appreciation of this decline and subsequent paralysis
of the creative faculty. Kartikeya, the god of war,
a younger son of Siva and Parvati, had his strong
hand in this, and how he invested and divested
mighty princes, who conquered or were defeated
and finally passed away, causing the rise and fall
of glorious kingdoms, is written in the <i>babads</i>, the
Javanese chronicles, by no means such old wives’
tales as Dominee Valentijn tried to make them out,
but containing in their extravagance a kernel of
stern reality, not the less explanatory of the condition
of the fairy island Java because the <i>magnanimes
mensonges</i> of a vivid imagination animate the dull
facts.</p>

<p>Of the Hindu empire Mataram in Central Java
nothing tangible is left except the ruins referred to,
a few objects in metal and stone, accidentally unearthed
or dug up by treasure-seekers, and some
inscriptions, title-deeds, etc., the scanty “genuine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
charters of Java” as van Limburg Brouwer defined
them. The name Mataram has been preserved on
a copper plate, dating from about 900, which agrees
in this respect with four other records, discovered
in East Java; the capital of the <i>Maharaja i
Mataram</i> is called Medang. For two centuries,
from the beginning of the eighth until the beginning
of the tenth, Mataram seems to have flourished as
the most powerful state in the island, especially
aggressive towards the east. Native tradition, in
fond exaggeration of her importance, makes her
sway the destinies of the world. Her star waned
suddenly; by what cause is unknown; but whether
it was the invasion of a mightier enemy or a natural
catastrophe, the same as that which overtook the
builders of the Diëng and the plain of Prambanan,
forcing them to leave their work unfinished, ancient
Mataram sank into insignificance. From the middle
of the tenth until the beginning of the sixteenth
century, the successors of her former eastern vassals,
that is whichever of them happened to be on top in
the continual struggle for supremacy, did in East and
Central Java as they pleased, warring, intermarrying,
annexing their neighbours’ domains, only to lose
them again and their own kingdoms to boot, to
usurpers, ambitious ministers, popular governors
of provinces, enterprising <i>condottieri</i> or mere
adventurers favoured by Dame Fortune. In that
overflowing arena of high rivalry, dynasties succeeding
one another with amazing rapidity, Daha,
situated in what is now Kediri, secured paramount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
influence after Kahuripan, situated in what is now
Southern Surabaya; then Tumapel, situated in
what is now Pasuruan, became ascendant; then
Daha once more and, last of the great Hindu
empires, Mojopahit, about 1300, to be overthrown,
after two centuries of preponderance, by the sword
of Islām. Jayabaya, King of Daha, from about
1130 till about 1160, has been called<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> the Charlemagne
of Java, in whose reign learning and letters
were encouraged; or the Javanese King Arthur,
whose life among his heroes, in peace and war, is
reflected in the idylls of the <i>Panji</i>-cycle, at whose
Court the famous poet Mpu Sedah began his version
of the <i>Mahabharata</i>, the <i>Brata Yuda</i>, finished by
Mpu Panulooh, author of the <i>Gatotkachasraya</i>,
while Tanakoong wrote the <i>Wretta-Sansaya</i>, a sort
of <i>Epistola de Arte Poetica</i>. When Tumapel expanded,
especially under Ken Angrok, troublous
times arrived for Daha, which could hardly hold
her own against the encroachments of that unscrupulous
monarch. Ken Angrok or Arok, born
in 1182 at Singosari, had seized the royal power
after assassinating the old King in 1222 or 1223.
The kris he used, had been ordered expressly for
that deed from the famous armourer Mpu Gandring,
who was its first victim because he tarried in
delivering it, the tempering of the steel having
taken more time than suited the usurper’s patience.
Dying under the murderous stroke, Mpu Gandring
uttered a prophetic curse: This kris will kill Ken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Angrok; it will kill his children and grandchildren;
it will kill seven kings. The prophecy came true
with wonderful exactness. Ken Angrok having
married Dedes, the widow of the old King he had
despatched, was himself killed as the third victim
of Mpu Gandring’s kris in the hand of a bravo
commissioned by their son Anusapati, the Hamlet
of Javanese history. And how blood followed blood
during the hundred years of Tumapel’s hegemony,
how Ken Angrok’s descendants harassed their
neighbours before the curse took effect upon each
of them, appearing like luminous stars in the sky of
politics and war, and then disappearing behind the
shadowy cloud of untimely death, is it not written
in the <i>Pararaton</i> or Book of the Kings of Tumapel
and Mojopahit?</p>

<p>The foundation of Mojopahit has been attributed
to scions of several royal families, among them to
Raden Tanduran, a prince of Pajajaran in West Java
which, it will be remembered, owed its origin to
princes of Tumapel. The most widely accepted
reading is, however, that a certain Raden Wijaya,
commander of the army of King Kertanegara,
great-grandson of Ken Angrok, profiting from his
master’s quarrels with Jaya Katong, ruler of Daha
in those days, carved out a kingdom for himself,
reclaiming, always with that end in view, a large
area of wild land, Mojo Lengko or Mojo Lengu,
near Tarik in Wirosobo, the present Mojokerto.
King Kertanegara who, by branding the Chinese
envoy Meng Ki, had stirred up trouble with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Flowery Empire, was unable to punish this act of
arrogance, and his violent death in a battle won by
the legions of Daha, meant the inglorious end of
Tumapel. This happened in 1292 and the expeditionary
force sent from China to chastise him
for his ungracious treatment of ambassadors to
his Court, consequently found their object accomplished
or, more correctly speaking, unaccomplishable
when landing in 1293. But its leader indemnified
his martial ardour by entering the service of
Raden Wijaya who, with his assistance, subjugated
Daha, which had tried to reassume her former
precedence. Firmly established on the throne of
the realm he had fashioned out of Daha, Tumapel
and his own territory near Tarik, he refused,
however, to pay the price stipulated by his Chinese
ally and when the auxiliary troops asked the fulfilment
of his promises, arms in hand, he proved to
them that superior strength is the ultimate arbiter
of right and sent them home much diminished in
numbers and pride. The Emperor of China, wroth
that the beautiful princesses of Tumapel, daughters
of the late King Kertanegara, whom he had deigned
to accept as concubines, were not forthcoming, but
stayed behind to adorn the harem of the self-made
King of Mojopahit, ordered his unsuccessful generalissimo
to be flogged by way of example to
other commanding officers. Raden Wijaya who,
with the kingly title, had assumed the name of
Kertarajasa, enjoyed his royal dignity only until
1295 and his ashes were entombed in two places not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
yet located: in the <i>dalem</i> (the inner, private part)
of his palace conformably to the Buddhist, and at
Simping conformably to the Sivaïte ritual, not
otherwise than King Kertanegara received last
honours in the guise of Siva-Buddha at Singosari
and in the guise of a Dhyani Buddha at Sakala,
and the remains of King Kertarajasa’s successor
were interred in three places according to the
Vishnuïte ritual, circumstances from which we
may conclude that in East as in Central Java the
different creeds lived together in most amiable
harmony.</p>

<p>The kris of Mpu Gandring might limit the
earthly term of the descendants of Ken Angrok, it
could not check their prowess while they were still
up and doing. Overlords of East and Central Java,
extending their rule to Pajajaran, they even looked for
conquest to the other islands of the Malay Archipelago.
Under Hayam Wurook or Rajasa Nagara,
in the latter half of the fourteenth century,
Mojopahit reached her zenith; a record of 1389
mentions Bali as being tributary since about 1340;
Aru, Palembang and Menangkabau in Sumatra,
Pahang with Tumanik in Malacca, Tanjong Pura in
Borneo, Dompo in Soombawa, Ceram and the
Goram islands acknowledged Nayam Wurook’s
suzerainty too. Seeing no more worlds to subdue,
he died and, as in the case of Alexander the Great,
his empire fell to pieces; in East Java itself
Balambangan seceded from Mojopahit proper and
the Muhammadan propaganda, fanning discord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
between the Hindu princes of old and new dynasties,
prepared their common doom. The beginnings of
the Islām in East Java have already been spoken of,
with Gresik as a missionary centre, Maulana Malik
Ibrahim as the first <i>wali</i> in that region and the
conversion into Moslim vassal states of the dependencies
of Mojopahit, whose princes, combining
under the auspices of Demak against their liege
lord, sealed his fate. Raden Patah of Demak was a
man of war and destiny. The fire of the new faith
burning fiercely within him, he hurled his defiance
at the stronghold of the heathen, speaking to the
last King of Mojopahit, his father or grandfather
according to tradition, as Amaziah, King of Juda,
spoke to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu,
King of Israël: Come, let us see one another in
the face,&mdash;but with a different result: the challenger
from Demak came out victorious and Mojopahit
ceased to exist, an issue fraught with grave
consequences. This occurred about the year 1500<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
and Raden Patah, pursuing the royal family on their
flight, defeated the King or one of his sons again
at Malang, where a last stand was made. But Gajah
Mada, the Prime Minister of Mojopahit, founded a
new empire, Supit Urang, which comprised much
of the territory once belonging to Singosari. The
Saivas also held out at Pasuruan, which was invested
by Pangeran Tranggana, a successor of Raden Patah,
but after his assassination by one of his servants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the troops of Demak returned home. Pasuruan and
Surabaya reverted, later on, to the Regent of
Madura, a son-in-law of Pangeran Tranggana. Yet,
Hinduïsm lingered on in the island; its political
power was only broken with the conquest of
Balambangan by the East India Company in 1767,
and the population of the Tengger mountain region
did not commence to accept the Islām until very
recently.</p>

<p>In the confusion which resulted after the death of
Pangeran Tranggana from the disruption of his
domains into Cheribon, Jayakarta and Bantam in
the western, Gresik and Kediri in the eastern, and
Demak proper and Pajang in the central part of the
island, the latter territory absorbed Jipang and its
Prince Tingkir, a scion of the royal family of
Mojopahit, was proclaimed Sooltan by the spiritual
authority of Gresik, the first time we find that title
mentioned in the history of Java. Sooltan Tingkir
appointed one of his trusted servants, Kiahi Ageng
Pamanahan, governor of the tract of land which had
preserved the name of Mataram. Kiahi Ageng
Pamanahan improved the condition of the people
and his son Suta Wijaya, who had married a
daughter of the Sooltan, making himself independent
by rebelling, by poisoning his father-in-law after
his having been captured and pardoned, finally by
taking possession of the regalia in the subsequent
war of succession, became master of the situation
and laid in New Mataram the foundation of another
state which, in the reign of his successor Ageng,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
1613-1646, gained the ascendency over the rest
of Java with Madura, subjugating even Sukadana
in West Borneo. Not, however, without strenuous
exertion for Balambangan gave a good deal of
trouble in the East and the conquest of Sumedang
in the West, in 1626, taxed the military strength
of the rising empire to its utmost. When the East
India Company began to make its influence felt,
Moslim solidarity proved a valuable asset as, for
instance, in the relations with Bantam and Cheribon,
whose Pangeran proposed the title of Susuhunan
for Ageng (1625) before Mecca promoted him to the
Sooltanate (1630). In 1628 and 1629 he ventured
to attack Batavia, the new settlement of the Dutch,
but had to retire and, what was even worse, by
provoking those upstart strangers, he damaged his
trade: they closed the channels of export to
Malacca and other foreign ports of rice, the
principal produce of the land. “Mataram must now
become our friend,” wrote the Governor-General
to his masters, the Honourable Seventeen, and,
indeed, Mangku Rat I., Ageng’s son, found himself
obliged to sign a treaty of friendship with the
Company&mdash;a dangerous friendship! Differences
between their “friend” and Bantam with Cheribon
were sedulously fostered by the authorities at
Batavia; the Company took a hand in the putting
down of disturbances created in East Java by
Taruna Jaya of Madura and Kraëng Galesoong of
Macassar; the Company patronised and protected
the reigning Sooltans, who moved their residence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
from Karta to Kartasura, against pretenders and
exacted payment in land, privileges, concessions,
monopolies, etc., shamelessly in excess of the real or
pretended assistance afforded in quelling purposely
manufactured anarchy&mdash;precisely as we see it happen
nowadays wherever western civilisation offers her
“disinterested” services to eastern countries of
promising complexion for exploitation by western
greed.</p>

<p>Mataram, trying to escape from the extortionate
friendship of the honey-tongued strangers at Batavia,
whose thirst for gold seemed unquenchable, has its
counterparts in benighted regions now being
“civilised” after the time-honoured recipe: interference
which upsets peace and order, more interference
to restore peace and order with the naturally
opposite result, occupation until peace and order
will be restored, gradual annexation. The East
India Company’s mean spirit of haggling was held
in utter contempt by the native princes, <i>grands
seigneurs</i> in thought and action, too proud to pay
the hucksters with their own coin, though bad
forebodings must have filled the mind, for instance,
of Susuhunan Puger, recognised at Batavia as
Mataram’s figurehead under the name of Paku
Buwono I.,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> when near his capital a Dutch fort was
built and garrisoned with Dutch soldiers to back
him in his exactions for the benefit of alien usurers
and sharpers. Like the rat of Ganesa, they pene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>trated
everywhere and the tale of their relations to
the lords of the land is one of tortuous insinuation
until they had firmly established themselves and
could give the rein to their sordid commercialism
in always more exorbitant claims. Paku Buwono
II., feeling his end approach, was prevailed upon, in
1749, to bequeath his realm to the Company, but
one of the most influential members of the imperial
family decided that this was carrying it a little too
far: Mangku Bumi,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> brother of Paku Buwono II.,
supported by Mas Saïd, son of the exiled Mangku
Negara,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and other <i>pangerans</i> (princes of the blood),
stood up in arms to defend their country’s rights
and inflicted severe losses on the Dutch troops in
stubborn guerrilla warfare. This led to the partition
of Mataram between Paku Buwono III. and
his uncle Mangku Bumi, both acknowledging the
supremacy of the Company, the latter settling at
Jogjakarta, the old capital Karta, under the title
and name of Sooltan Mangku Buwono,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> while Mas
Saïd, who did not cease hostilities before 1757,
gained also a quasi-independent position as Pangeran
Adipati Mangku Negara, which in 1796 became
hereditary. With three reigning princes for one,
the power of Mataram was definitely broken and
Batavia assumed the direction of her affairs quite
openly, the “thundering field-marshal” Daendels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
emphasising her state of decline and the British
Interregnum bringing no change.</p>

<p>In 1825 the divided remnant of Mataram, viz.
Surakarta with the Mangku Negaran and Jogjakarta
with the Paku Alaman,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> was deeply stirred by
Pangeran Anta Wiria calling upon his compatriots
to chase the oppressors away. Born from a woman
of low descent among the wives of Mangku
Buwono III., Sooltan of Jogjakarta, it seems that,
nevertheless, hopes of his succession to the throne
had been held out to him when he assisted his
father against the machinations of his grandfather,
Sooltan Sepooh (Mangku Buwono II.), banished by
Raffles in 1812. However this may be, he resented
the settlement of the Sooltanate on the death of
Mangku Buwono III. upon Jarot, an infant son,
and other circumstances adding to his dislike of
Dutch control, he raised the standard of revolt.
The Javanese responded with alacrity to an appeal
which bore good tidings of delivery as the wind,
ridden by the Maroots who make the mountains to
tremble and tear the forest into pieces, bears good
tidings of coming rain to a parched earth. Anta
Wiria, under his more popular name of Dipo Negoro,
and his lieutenants Ali Bassa Prawira Dirja, or
Sentot, and Kiahi Maja, gave the Dutch troops
plenty of bloody work in the five years during
which the Java war lasted, 1825-1830. It was the
last eruption on a large scale of the fire imprisoned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the native’s heart, the last sustained effort at regaining
his independence, crushed by the white man’s
superiority in military appliances, but occasional
throbbings, ruffling the surface as in Bantam (1888),
the Preanger Regencies (1902), Kediri (1910), etc.,
show that the volcano is by no means an extinguished
one. Though “kingdoms are shrunk to provinces
and chains clank over sceptred cities,” the love
of liberty, laid by as a sword which eats into itself,
does not own foreign dominion, and the native
princes, especially the Susuhunan of Surakarta and
the Sooltan of Jogjakarta, remain objects of worshipful
homage. Their genealogy remounts to the gods
whose essence took substance in the illustrious
prophet Adam who begat Abil and Kabil on the
goddess Kawa; the history of their house begins
with the arrival in the island, in the Javanese
year 1, of Aji Soko; they are the <i>panatagama</i>
and <i>sayidin</i> (<i>shah ad-din</i>), directors and leaders
of religion; their Courts set the fashion in
high native society, Solo<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> being more gay and
extravagant, Jogja<a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> more sedate and solid, as a
writer at the end of the eighteenth century already
remarked.</p>

<p>The Dutch Government recognises the imperial
or royal dignity of Susuhunan and Sooltan by the
superior position of its Residents in the capitals of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
their Principalities, who, directly responsible to the
Governor-General, correspond in rank to the general
officers of the army, while the administrative heads
of the other residencies have to content themselves
with the honours due to a colonel; also by the
institution of dragoon body-guards whose ostensibly
ornamental presence can be and has been turned to
good account when the mental intoxication arising
from meditation on gilded disgrace, charged with
the lightning of passion, produces effects irreconcilable
with the fiction that all is for the best in this
best of worlds. With the Government steadily
encroaching on the native princes’ ancient rights,
bitterness grows apace and irritation at the recoiling
weight of bondage lives on, though colonial reports
represent it as dead. Truly, in the three centuries
during which it pleased Kuwera, the fat god of
wealth, to inspire the strangers from the West, rich
in promise but slow in performance, exacting and
pitiless, to deeds of unprincipled rapacity, the people
have learned to hide their thoughts that worse may
not follow, hoping that time will set things right.
But as everything points more clearly to the fixed
purpose of the Dutch Government to avail themselves
of every pretext for swallowing the Principalities
as all the rest has been gobbled up, there
are those who cherish the memory of Dipo Negoro
and consider the necessity of new man-offerings:
the greater the need, the greater must be the
propitiation. On the whole, however, better counsel
prevails, deliverance being sought on planes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
mystic exercise, silent submission being practised
in expectation of the consummation of a higher
will, and this is the native’s secret as he repeats
the lessons inculcated in the <i>Wulang Reh</i>, the
treatise on ethics written by one of the eminent of
the past, Sunan Paku Buwono IV.: May ye imitate
our ancestors, who were endowed with supernatural
strength, and may ye qualify for penitence, heeding
closely the perfection of life; this is my prayer for
my children; be it granted! Meanwhile taxation
increases, but who can object to that when in days
of old the good people had to pay for the privilege
of looking at the public dancers, whether they cared
to look at them or not; when compulsory contributions
to the exchequer were levied upon one-eyed
persons for their being so much better off than the
totally blind; etc.... Fancy a Minister of Finance
in Holland defending a vexatious new assessment
on the ground of arbitrary cesses in the Middle
Ages!</p>

<p>Hindu art had lost its vitality when the second
empire of Mataram arose in Central Java and the
cult of the ideal was effected by modernising currents
from the eastern part of the island. Sanskrit, as the
vehicle of thought in Venggi and Nagari characters,
made place for Kawi which, related in its oldest
forms to Pali and in its symbols to the Indian
alphabets, evolved soon afterward into a specific
Javanese type. Sivaïte literature paved the way
for the <i>Manik Maya</i>, the <i>Bandoong</i>, the <i>Aji Saka</i>,
the <i>Panji</i>- and the <i>Menak</i>- or <i>Hamza</i>-cycles, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
<i>Damar Wulan</i>; as to Buddhist literature, Burnouf’s
comment upon its inferiority holds also good for
Java: no trace exists even of a life of the Buddha,
of <i>jataka</i>-tales, except such as have originated in
the eastern kingdoms at a comparatively late date.
Literary culture in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries was a continuation of and throve on the
efforts of the great authors hospitably entertained
at the Courts of Mojopahit and Kediri. The
Javanese language with the wealth of words it
acquired and the diversity of expression it
developed,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> exercised and still exercises in its
four dialects<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> a vivifying influence upon the
Soondanese speech in the west and the Madurese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
in the east. Its script, like the people who speak
and write it, and cling to their <i>hadat</i>, the manners
and customs of the <i>jaman buda</i>, which, notwithstanding
their Islāmitic veneer, they prefer to the
law of the Prophet,&mdash;its script rejects Moslim interference
and refuses to employ the Arabic characters,
sticking to its equally beautiful <i>aksaras</i> and
<i>pasangans</i>. Religions succeeding one another,
generally without discourteous haste, Muhammadanism
penetrated Central Java but slowly from
the north, first by the conversion of the great and
mighty who profited by the example of Mojopahit,
then by grafting the idea of the one righteous god
upon the godless Buddhist or pantheistic Hindu
creed of the <i>orang kechil</i>, the man of slight importance
who, up to this day, though fervent in his
outward duties as a Moslim, shows in every act
that his individual and national temperament is
rooted in pre-Islāmic idiosyncrasies. The heroes
of the <i>Brata Yuda</i> and <i>Ramayana</i> are just as dear
to him as the pre-Islāmic saints whose legends are
gathered in the story of <i>Raja Pirangon</i> and the
<i>Kitab Ambia</i>, as the forerunners, companions and
helpers of the Apostle of God.</p>

<p>The sacred <i>waringin</i>, never wanting in the <i>aloon
aloon</i>, the open places before the dwellings of the
rulers of the land and their deputies, what is it but
the bo-tree, the tree of enlightenment? One of
venerable age in the imperial burial-ground of
Pasar Gedeh, planted, according to tradition, by
Kiahi Ageng Pamanahan or his son Suta Wijaya,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
announces without fail the demise of a member of
one of the reigning families either at Solo or at
Jogja, by shedding one of its branches. Pasar
Gedeh, Selo and Imogiri are silent spots, peopled
with the dead whose lives’ strength made history
and is mourned as the strength of a glorious past.
Selo, an enclave belonging to Surakarta, in Grobogan,
residency Samarang, contains the ancestral tombs
of the rulers of Mataram; Imogiri and Pasar Gedeh
in Jogjakarta, which latter marks the site of the
original seat of empire and was comparatively
recently put to its present use, are the cemeteries
common to the royalty of both Principalities, and
guarded by officials, <i>amat dalam</i> with the title of
Raden Tumenggoong, appointed by mutual consent.
A Polynesian bias to ancestor-worship, unabated by
Hinduïsm, Buddhism and Muhammadanism, accounts
for the almost idolatrous adoration<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> of the graves of
the Susuhunans and Sooltans, their ancestors and
also their progeny that did not attain to thrones,
receptacles of once imperial dust, feeding the four
elements from which it proceeded and to which it
returns like meaner human clay. Look, says Kumala
in the Buddhist parable, all in the world must perish!
The religious brethren of his faith used to repair at
night to the sepulchres of those taken to bliss and
spend the lone hours in pondering on the instability
of conscious existence, desiring to gain the Nirvana
by their undisturbed meditations, but Sivaïte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
associations people the old graveyards of Java with
<i>raksasas</i>, monstrous giants, eaters of living and
dead men and women, and santons, bent on prayer
amid the last abodes of the departed, have been
terrified, especially at Pasar Gedeh, by weird noises
and apparitions signalling their approach, commending
hasty retreat to the wise. It is advisable
to distrust darkness there and rather to choose the
day for acts of devotion, even if annoyed by worldlings
who come to consult the big white tortoise in
the tank, ancient Kiahi Duda, widower of Mboq
Loro Kuning, presaging the better luck the farther
he paddles forth from his subaqueous habitation.
At a little distance is the <i>sela gilang</i>, a bluish stone
with a more than half effaced inscription, only the
lettering of the border being legible. Tradition
calls it the <i>dampar</i> (throne) of Suta Wijaya, sitting
on which he killed Kiahi Ageng Mangir, his rival
and owner of the miraculous lance Kiahi Baru, who
had been lured into his presence by one of his
daughters to do homage by means of the <i>ujoong</i>,
the kissing<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> of the knee; near by are a stone mortar
and large stone cannon-balls, the largest possessing
the faculty of granting untold wealth to those strong
enough to carry it three times without stopping
round the <i>sela gilang</i>, whose legend, carved by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
prisoner of war, either a spirit of the air or a
magician, reveals in its marginal commentary a
philosophic mind coupled with linguistic talents:
<i>zoo gaat de wereld&mdash;così va il mondo&mdash;ita movet tuus
mundus&mdash;ainsi va le monde</i>.</p>

<p>Selo, Imogiri and Pasar Gedeh: so goes the
world indeed, and the nameless prisoner of war’s
motto, preserved near the <i>pasarahan dalam</i>, the
imperial garden of rest, would be hardly less
appropriate over the gates leading to the <i>kratons</i>,
the residences<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> of the Susuhunan of Surakarta and
the Sooltan of Jogjakarta, where they do the grand
in the grand old way, cherishing the memories of a
power gone by. A visit to the Principalities without
an invitation to attend some function at Court
cannot be called complete and it is a treat to watch
the ceremonial exercises connected with one of the
three <i>garebegs</i><a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> or with the salutations on imperial
birthdays and coronation-days in the roomy <i>pendopos</i>,
the open halls whose general style betrays its
Hindu origin no less than the aspect, the dresses,
the movements of the native nobility, officials and
retainers, an assemblage of a fairy tale, betray their
Hindu parentage. The <i>bangsal kenchono</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
audience-chamber of the Sooltan at Jogja, is a
masterpiece of construction in wood, the carved
beams and joists, richly gilt and painted in bright
colours, forming a ceiling of wonderful airiness and
elegance; in the <i>bangsal witono</i> the Sooltan shows
himself to the people on days of great gala; in the
<i>bangsal kemandoongan</i>, a hall in one of the many
open squares of the palace grounds, seated on his
<i>dampar</i> or throne, he used to witness the execution
of his subjects sentenced to death, who were krissed<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
against the opposite wall; another of these open
squares was dedicated to pleasures which remind
of the <i>munera gladiatoria</i>, more especially of the
<i>ludi funebres</i>, and kindred amusements with a good
deal of local colour: we find it chronicled of
Sunan Mangku Rat I., Java’s Nero, that once
he beguiled a tedious afternoon in his <i>kraton</i> at
Kartasura by stripping a hundred young women
and letting a few tigers loose among them. The
dining-hall (<i>gedong manis</i>: room of sweets) in the
<i>kraton</i> at Jogja, to the south of the audience-chamber,
can easily hold three hundred guests with
the host of servants they require; at Solo the
imperial stables and coach-houses<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> are scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
inferior in interest to the friend of horses, riding,
driving and coaching, than the Kaiserlich-Königliche
Marstall at Vienna or the Caballerizas Reales at
Aranjuez. But of all the sights at the Courts of
the Principalities of Central Java it is the human
element that fascinates most, a waving mass of
silent figures in the magnificent setting which
reflects centuries of <i>Sturm und Drang</i>, the new to
the visitor’s eye being nothing but the very, very
old; men taught by fate to treasure their thoughts
up in their hearts, as their mountains do the hidden
fire, worshipping <i>tempu dahulu</i>, sustained by <i>l’amour
du bon vieulx tems</i>, <i>l’amour antique</i>, even the rising
generation remaining apparently unaffected by the
example of western fickleness, an inconstancy ever
more pronounced since the illustrious citizen of
Florence, of the Porta San Piera, commented on it:</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>The country-seats of Susuhunans and Sooltans,
where they sought repose from cares of state, often
contained temples erected, if not in the name then
in the spirit of their kind of sacrifice, to Kama, the
god of love, smuggled into the practice of a later
creed. They had no wish to become the victims
of their virtue like the excellent King Suvarnavarna;
they did not aspire to the fame accruing to Rama in
his relations to the female demon Shoorpanakha,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
personification of sublunar temptations. And the
manifold functions assigned to water in their
pleasances, to the limpid, running water of the cool
mountain rills, are characteristic of an island where
a bath, at least twice a day, preferably in the open,
is both a necessity and a luxury which the poorest
does not dream of denying himself. Observe the
crowds of men, women and children, always chaste
and decent, disporting themselves in lakes and rivers,
every morning and every evening; note the names
of Pikataän, Kali Bening, Banyu Biru, idyllic spots
and equal to the classic <i>chandi</i> Pengilon, Sidamookti
and Wanasari to the lover of a plunge and a swim,
screened by flowers and foliage, with the blue heaven
smiling on his joy. Passing by Ambar Winangoon
and Ambar Rookma, the remains of the so-called
water-castle at Jogjakarta convey some notion of the
manner in which royal personages sought recreation,
amusing themselves in their parks of delight, fragrant
and tranquil like the restful Loombini, where Maya
gave birth to the Buddha; toying with their women
in and round the crystalline fluid. An abundant
spring within the boundaries of the palace grounds
led to the conception of this retreat or, rather, these
retreats, for there were two, connected by a system
of canals which speaks highly for native hydraulics,
though the buildings erected to obey a capricious
will, show in their present ruinous state how architecture
had degraded since the Hindu period, its
flimsy productions being unable to withstand the
first serious earthquake. Of Pulu Gedong, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
northeast of the <i>aloon aloon kidool</i>, nothing is left
but crumbling portions of the walls which jealously
guarded the privacy of the Sooltan’s watersports.
Of Taman Sari and Taman Ledok, situated in the
western part of the <i>kraton</i>, a good deal is still
recognisable, especially the structures on Pulu
Kenanga in the largest of the artificial lakes which
are now dry ground, the one here meant being
incorporated into a <i>kampong</i>, one of the several
groups of native dwellings inhabited by the Sooltan’s
numerous retainers. The whilom islands convey
in quite a picturesque way the lesson that human
works must die like the hands that fashioned
them.</p>

<div class="caption">XIII. WATER-CASTLE AT JOGJAKARTA<br />(Centrum.)</div>
</div>

<p>The building of the “water-castle”, whose
pavilions, artificial lakes, tanks and gardens spread
over an area of about twenty-five acres, was begun
in 1758 by a Buginese architect under the orders
of Mangku Buwono I., a great raiser of edifices, as
Nicolaas Hartingh<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> wrote in 1761, and maker of
“fountains, grotto-work and conduits which, though
completed, he orders immediately to be pulled down,
not finding them to his taste, thus squandering some
little money.” We possess a description<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> of the
<i>kraton</i> at Jogjakarta, dated September 1791, from
the hand of Carl Friedrich Reimer,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> who speaks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
“a collection of gardens, fish-ponds and pleasure-pools.”
He probably visited Pulu Gedong before
proceeding to Taman Sari<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and expatiates on the
spaciousness of the dwelling room in Pulu Kananga,
where it seems that the Court could find plenty
of accommodation. But what made the greatest
impression on the expert in hydraulics was the
arrangement of passages and an apartment for
prayer and meditation under water, as if the Sooltan
deemed it an advantage to worship surrounded
by the babbling stream, light and fresh air being
provided through turrets rising above the surface.
In the place called Oombool Winangoon, situated
on a low level, with three tanks, fed from the great
lake of Taman Sari, was a cool retreat where the
Sooltan used to rest a while after his bath, refreshing
himself with a cup of tea. Alluding to the Sumoor
Gumuling, Reimer remarks that the architect must
have chosen a round form for his structure to make
it the better resist the pressure of the water all
round. The strange building which went by that
name and consisted of two concentric walls with a
flat roof,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> taken for a subaqueous house of prayer
by the visitor of 1791, has also been very differently
explained: some see in its remains a dancing-school,
awakening visions of the Sooltan’s <i>corps de ballet</i>
practising in the first storey to the dulcet tones of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
<i>gamelan</i>, the native orchestra, that ascended from the
basement and aided them in going through their
paces; others connect it with functions never referred
to in polite society and which have nothing in common
with praying, either with the heart or with the feet,
more correctly speaking: with the arms, hands and
hips, for Javanese dancing is no loose skipping and
hopping about, but a graceful and expressive play
of the body and more particularly of the upper limbs
in rhythmic, undulating motion. Passing from one
lake to the next, the Sooltan’s means of conveyance
was the <i>prahu</i> Niahi Kuning, a gorgeously decorated
barge, given to him by the East India Company;
other boats, plying between Taman Sari and Taman
Ledok, were at the disposal of the ladies of the
royal household desirous of an outing with their
babies; two small skiffs left their moorings every
night alternately, at a signal given on a <i>bendeh</i>, to
feed the fishes, which knew the sound and assembled
in shoals. The guard-rooms near the northern
watergate, of which the remaining one, <i>i.e.</i> the
one not altogether fallen into ruin, shelters in
the morning a motley crowd of sellers of fruit,
vegetables, sweetmeats, etc., witnesses to the
Company’s dragoons, protecting and shadowing
their Highnesses of Surakarta and Jogjakarta with
the princes of their blood, already having been
entrusted with that task in the days of Mangku
Buwono I.</p>

<p>Of the delicately carved woodwork hardly a trace
remains, but some foliage and birds among flowers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
executed in stucco, give evidence of a good taste
which knew how to make old motives subservient
to new requirements. Though a Muhammadan
pleasance, designed by a Muhammadan architect for
a Muhammadan prince, the <i>garuda</i> over one of the
entrances, the Banaspatis on gables and fronts in
Taman Sari and Taman Ledok, the <i>nagas</i> coping
the balustrades of the staircases, show that Hindu
conceptions continued to leaven Javanese art. The
relations with China and the consequent influx of
Chinamen have also borne their fruit in Central
Java as in Cheribon and the eastern kingdoms:
Reimer informs us that the galleries and tops (now
gone) of the several buildings were constructed like
pointed vaults, and were wrought “in the manner
of Chinese roofs”; Pulu Gedong was famous for
the lofty Chinese tower erected near the spring
which furnished the water for the “castle”, its lakes,
ponds, tanks and canals, and for the irrigation of its
grounds. The orchards, renowned for their mangoes
and pine-apples, the vegetable-, sirih- and flower-gardens
had a great reputation in the land; assiduous
attention was paid to horticulture on the principle,
well understood by oriental gardeners, that flower-beds,
ornamental groves and bowers are like women;
that however much art and pains are bestowed on
their make-up, the art of arts is the concealment
thereof.... Writing this it occurs to me how properly
a western version of that universally approved
maxim has been put in the mouth of <i>Gärtnerinnen</i>,
<i>niedlich</i> and <i>galant</i>:</p>

<div class="caption">XIV. WATER-CASTLE AT JOGJAKARTA<br />(Centrum.)</div>
</div>

<p>Though Mangku Buwono I. was a contemporary
of Goethe, his knowledge of <i>Faust</i> is extremely
doubtful, but being an artist in his own way, he
took care that the natural scenery, assisted by art,
should contribute to a pleasant general impression
in the distribution of the dwellings for his retinue:
native princes (and of his rank too!) do not move an
inch inside or outside their <i>kratons</i> without numberless
attendants at their heels. In the “water-castle”
were apartments, not only for the Sooltan,
for the Ratu, his first legitimate spouse, for his other
wives and concubines, for the little family they had
presented him with, but for the dignitaries of his
Court, officials of all degrees, secretaries, servants
of every description, various artificers from the
armourers down to the <i>kebon kumukoos</i>, the makers
of <i>tali api</i> (fire-rope), necessary for lighting his
Highness’ cigars. There were reception-, dining-,
living- and sleeping-rooms for the Sooltan, his Ratu
and female relatives, each apart; common rooms for
the <i>selir</i> (wives of lower degree); rooms for the
instruction of their children; rooms where his
Highness’ daughters spent a few hours every day in
<i>batikking</i>; guard-rooms for the <i>prajurits</i>, the male
guards; guard-rooms for the female guards under
command of the Niahi Tumanggoong, a lady of
consequence, who kept and keeps the <i>dalam</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
interior of the <i>kraton</i>, under constant observation so
that no illicit <i>amourettes</i> shall occur in the women’s
quarters, and yet&mdash;! There were store-rooms,
kitchens, workshops, prisons, halls set apart for the
dancers, male and female; the cream of the female
dancers, the <i>srimpis</i> and girl <i>bedoyos</i>, were probably
housed in or near the principal pavilion on Pulu
Kananga, of which the Sooltan occupied the eastern
and the Ratu the western portion. Above all there
were the bath-rooms, dedicated to Kama and his
wife Rati of Hindu memory; and since the parrot
is the <i>vahana</i> of that frivolous god, many are the
unspeakable tales of revived rites of his luxurious
worship.</p>

<p>The etiquette at Court is fitly illustrated by the
two tea-houses of Taman Sari, the eastern one for
the Grand Pourer-out-of-Tea of the Right, who
presided over the preparation of the delectable
beverage for the Sooltan, and the western ditto for
the Grand Pourer-out-of-Tea of the Left, who provided
for the Ratu. A scrupulous punctilio is ingrained
in Javanese habits and customs, from high
to low, on great and small occasions, the native’s
mentality always reverting to things which were,
but never more can be. The homage done to
sacred objects, arms, <i>gamelans</i>, etc., by giving them a
human name and a title,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> venerating them as if en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>dowed
with supernatural faculties, recalls Polynesian
fetishism, Hinduïsm being blended with it in Siva’s
<i>trishula</i>, Vishnu’s <i>chakra</i>, etc., which are still carried
behind the native princes among their <i>ampilan</i>.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
The <i>upacharas</i> or imperial and royal <i>pusakas</i><a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> are
treated with the utmost reverence when shown at
the appearance in public of Susuhunan or Sooltan,
and their bearers, the <i>koncho ngampil</i>, who hold an
honoured position at the Courts of Solo and Jogja,
may be considered direct successors of the envoys
of King Dasharatha on the reliefs of the <i>chandi</i>
Loro Jonggrang, who bore his regalia when meeting
Rama and Lakshama. The strange ceremonial,
preserved from the time when gods walked amongst
men, seems hardly antiquated, on the contrary very
germane to <i>siti-inggil</i><a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> surroundings. One need
not visit the <i>kratons</i> though, to notice how the spirit
of the past permeates all things Javanese; any well-dressed
native getting out of his <i>sado</i><a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> at the railway
station or repairing thither on foot for a journey
with the fire-carriage, will do. Even if he cannot
afford the few <i>doits</i><a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> necessary and must impair his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
dignity by going afoot, he has his retainers to look
after his box and, stuck behind, he has his magnificent
kris in a sheath of gold, with a beautifully carved
ivory handle, in nine cases out of ten a <i>pusaka</i>,
cherished like the kris Kolo Munyang of the Prince
of Kudoos or, as others allege, of a Susuhunan of
Surakarta, who sent the weapon, which killed its
master’s enemies without human direction, to the
assistance of Pangeran Bintoro, then oppressed by a
king of Mojopahit. The chronology of this legend
is evidently a little faulty, but, O! the wonders
of Java’s golden age, and, O! the superstitious
honour in which their memory is held by these
lovable people, whose actual existence is a dream of
days gone by. And that happy dream, they ween,
is a presage of the future, prophesying the restoration
of their fathers’ heritage. If, nevertheless, the
hour draws near of unconditional surrender, the
Dutch Government steadily and surely arrogating
to itself the externals with the substance of power
in the Principalities, they will silently submit to the
<i>nivarana</i> of their ancient faith, the hindrance arising
from torpor of mind appointed to them in the
<i>sansara</i>, the rotary sequence of the world, and seek
consolation in the promise of their new faith that
the Lord will not deal wrongly with his servants.

<p>When, suddenly, for reasons still unknown, the
classic period of art in Central Java closed, about 850
Saka (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 928), East Java awakened and entered on
an era of artistic activity in every direction, which
lasted until the fall of Mojopahit six centuries and a
half later. In architecture it offers nothing so grand
and imposing as the ancient temples of the Middle
Empire, but much more diversity, and numerous inscriptions,
resembling, after 900 Saka (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 978), in
form and contents, what we possess of old Javanese
literature, enable us in many cases to determine
the dates and also the character of the <i>chandis</i>,
found principally along the course of the Brantas
in the residencies Pasuruan, Kediri and Surabaya.
Moving eastward, it was there that Hindu civilisa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>tion
made greatest progress, no more in the
vigorous enthusiasm of a young faith eager to
proselyte, but modified by and finally succumbing
to the influences of the soil, the climate, the
idiosyncrasies of the aborigines. The oldest dates
(Madioon, Kediri, Surabaya and Pasuruan) fall
between 890 and 1140; then we have a good many
again from Kediri (1120-1240 and 1270-1460) and
from Surabaya (1270-1490); also from Pasuruan,
Probolinggo and Besuki (1340-1470), Madura
(1290-1440) and Rembang (1370-1390); finally, the
constructive energy returning to Central Java, from
Samarang and Surakarta (1420-1460), Suku and
Cheto bringing up the rear. In the palmy days of
Daha and Tumapel a sort of transition style was
elaborated; under Ken Angrok and his descendants
on the throne of Mojopahit, East Java reached its
architectural zenith, never equal in the grandeur of
its conceptions to the Boro Budoor or even the
Prambanan temples, to the symmetrical richness of
the Mendoot, but making up in fantastic decoration
what it had lost in sobriety of outline. The builders
pandered to the unwholesome demand for that
perfection at any cost which Ruskin censures as the
main mistake of the Renaissance in its early stages,
the workman losing his soul in exchange for
consummate finish. But, though they bear the
impress of decadence, the products of eastern
Javanese constructive efforts are not wholly
degenerate, never coarse or vulgar and well worth
looking at from more than one point of view. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
evolution of the ornament alone is exceedingly
suggestive: the “recalcitrant spiral” which in
Central Java ascends, decking the supports, topples,
as it were, in East Java, losing its character and
becoming a meaningless adornment of the casements
of, <i>e.g.</i>, the <i>chandi</i> Panataran; the <i>kala</i>-heads
remain but the <i>makaras</i> change into a flame-like
embellishment; where they are altogether dissolved,
as in the <i>chandi</i> Jago or Toompang, it is safe to
conclude with Dr. Brandes to late eastern Javanese
influences.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>It has been conjectured that the migration of
Hinduïsm to East Java was the effect of Buddhism
gaining ground in the central part of the island;
that the pronounced Sivaïte tendencies of Mojopahit
were a reaction against Buddhist innovations.
But it remains still to be proved that
Mojopahit, though worshipping Siva as the supreme
god of the Trimoorti, adhered to his overlordship
in all its orthodox purity. There are, on
the contrary, indications of Vishnuïte leanings, of
Buddhist heresy, of a syncretism no less pronounced
than that of Prambanan and the Mendoot. In the
time of Old Mataram’s hegemony, Buddhism must
have ingratiated itself to some extent with her
eastern vassals and, though not one of the temples
in East Java is Buddhist after the fashion of the
<i>chandis</i> Boro Budoor, Mendoot and Sewu, vestiges
of the Bhagavat’s doctrine are undeniable in Kediri,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Southern Surabaya and Northern Pasuruan. A
fusion of Sivaïsm and Buddhism has continuously
controlled the construction of the larger temples
of the later eastern Javanese period, says Rouffaer.
Statues found in many places, <i>e.g.</i> in the <i>chandi</i>
Toompang, are distinctly Buddhist and, what is
most remarkable, though of later workmanship than
those of Central Java and of a different style, tainted
by decadent methods, they possess high merits as
works of art. In their Sivaïtic surroundings they
confirm the statements of the Chinese traveller
Hiuen Tsiang who, perambulating India between
629 and 645, before the persecution of the Buddhists
commenced, remarked upon the tolerance of the
brahmins and <i>vice versa</i>, a virtue the Hindus carried
with them to Java as already observed in the chapter
on Prambanan. The kings of Mojopahit followed
the example set in those regions: they were
Saivas, Vaishnavas, Buddhists or followers of no
one creed in particular, ready to protect and prefer
each of them according to circumstances. In codes
of law and poetry, Sivaïte priests and <i>sugatas</i>, pious
brethren on the Buddhist road to perfection, are
mentioned in one breath as conductors of the
religious exercises on festive occasions, invoking the
blessings of heaven on harvests and enterprises of
peace and war; the poet Tantular calls the Buddha
one with the Trimoorti.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The Muhammadans were not so indulgent when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the Pangerans of Giri increased in authority as
spiritual leaders of their faith, successors of Maulana
Ibrahim, its first apostle in East Java. The hillock
of Giri became a centre of incitement to the holy
war, particularly so under Raden Ratu Paku or
Sunan Prabu Satmoto, whose tomb is still an object
of Moslim pilgrimage.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> With his approval, if not
on his instigation, the Muhammadan states on
the north coast combined under Raden Patah of
Demak to compass the extermination of heathenism
and he lived to see the overthrow of Mojopahit,
though dying shortly afterwards. If the Moslemin
yearned to gain Paradise, sword in hand, martyrs
for their Prophet’s dispensation, those of the old
creed remembered the power of <i>their</i> gods, blowing
the <i>sanka</i>, the war-shell of Vishnu, who proved to
Sugriva and Hanoman his superiority over Wali by
shooting his arrow through seven palm-trunks; who,
in his fourth <i>avatar</i>, as <i>narasinha</i>, the man-lion,
ripped open the belly of the sacrilegious demon
Hiranya Kasipu. But Raden Patah, marching with
his allies, marvellously helped in the way of the
Lord against the idolaters of Mojopahit, the
swollen with pride, proved to be the giant in the
shape of a dwarf, Vamana, known from their god’s
fifth <i>avatar</i>, conqueror of the three worlds. And
Mojopahit, so great that the claims to the honour
of her foundation, forwarded by as many princely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
houses as existed in those days, were fused in the
tradition of her divine origin, her capital with its
hundred gates and shining streets and palaces, the
like of which had never been seen, having sprung from
the earth in one night as a flower at the call of the
fragrant dawn,&mdash;Mojopahit was overthrown and,
laments the Javanese chronicle, the prosperity of the
island disappeared. Not the last but the strongest
bulwark of Hinduïsm had ceased to exist, bearing
bitter fruit<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> of presumptuous pride indeed; the
later Hindu empires, even Balambangan, which
gave so much trouble to New Mataram and submitted
only to the arms of the East India Company,
leaving the ancient creed to die of slow exhaustion
in the Tengger mountains, were nothing compared
to her.</p>

<p>Like the remains, near the <i>dessa</i> Galang, of the
<i>kraton</i> of the kings of the older empire of Daha,
what has escaped total destruction of the capital of
Mojopahit is constructed of brick. The ruins are
situated about eight miles to the southwest of
Mojokerto<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> in the valley of the Brantas; near
Ngoomplak was the site of a royal residence in the
building of which stone seems also to have been
used. Raffles, visiting those heaps of debris scattered
over quite a large area, found but scanty evidence
of the fact that he trod the spot where great rulers
had employed great architects, raising great structures
for posterity to remember their great deeds by;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Wardenaar, whom he had taken with him as a
draughtsman, might have stayed at Batavia, though
in his <i>History of Java</i> he gives an illustration of
“one of the gateways” and says that the marks of
former grandeur there are more manifest than at
Pajajaran, which, well considered, is saying very
little. Now, a century later, a century of continued
neglect, the general impression is still less calculated
to prompt a vision of heroes subjecting thrones and
dominions in the short space left them by their
ancestor Ken Angrok’s murderous kris, defying
the grave, unmindful of Mpu Gandring’s curse.
Walking round in an effort to fit the scenery to
historical dramas of love, hate and ambition, extreme
care is necessary to avoid stepping on snakes coiled
in dangerous repose or crawling among the brickbats
which represent the foundations of princely mansions,
digesting their last meal or hungry after the lizards
that move restlessly in and out of chinks and
crannies, lively beasties, enjoying the sunshine until
snapped up, far more interesting really than the
piles of rubbish bearing meaningless names. The
natives one meets, will spin yarns <i>ad libitum</i> anent
the numerous graves and crumbling substructures,
but few have an intelligible tale to tell. Here are
portions of the city-wall; there the remnant of the
gate Bajang Ratu; half a mile farther the <i>aloon
aloon</i>, the <i>taman</i> or pleasance, the tanks for bathing.
A road, in great need of repair, leads through the
Trowulan, the interior; exterior roads may be taken
through ricefields and teak-plantations to the tomb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of Ratu Champa, distinguished by curtains which
once may have been white. Before a small building,
enclosed by a fence, lies a stone supposed to cover
the entrance to a subterranean apartment, the hiding-place,
it is said, of the last king of Mojopahit when
his capital was taken by the Moslim enemy. More
graves surround that cache, graves without and, to
intimate the pre-eminent importance of the elect thus
honoured, graves <i>with</i> dirty curtains, narrow strips
of soiled cloth, sad offerings to the dead sovereigns
of an empire of celestial fame. One feels almost
inclined to refuse credence to the grand past this
ragged display tries to commemorate and, from sheer
disappointment, to join the ranks of the sceptics
who doubt of the capital of Mojopahit ever having
amounted to much, and maintain that, in any case,
it had come down and was of no consequence
compared with Tuban and Gresik, already in 1416,
a century before its falling into the hands of the
Muhammadans.</p>

<p>At Mojopahit it is the same old story of quarrying
for building material: several sugar-mills in the
neighbourhood with the dwellings of managers and
employees, have been wholly or partly constructed
of Mojopahit bricks. In 1887 I saw them used for
the abutments of bridges, foremen of the Department
of Public Works superintending. A short time
before, twelve copper plates had been found with
inscriptions in ancient characters, which disappeared
in a mysterious way. The <i>rechos</i> of Mojopahit
were mostly left alone, a respectful treatment they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
owed to their general clumsiness. Some two or
three miles from the ruins of the capital, a goodly
number stand or lie together fair samples of statuary
of the first eastern Javanese period, in its extravagance
and exaggeration a travesty of the classic art of
Central Java, crudity of conception floundering in
a redundancy of form also observable at the <i>chandis</i>
Suku and Cheto; after the fall of Mojopahit, in
the second period, the sculptor reverted to a close
study of nature as manifested at the <i>chandis</i> Toompang
and Panataran; in the third, Hindu methods
getting crowded within ever narrower limits, his
fancy betrayed him again into lavish detail as
exemplified in old Balinese imagery. At the gradual
extinction of Hindu ideals of beauty, realised in
decaying stone and brick, in statues defaced and
vanishing like dwindling phantoms, a growing sensation
of emptiness, emphasised by vague reminiscences
of the artistic fullness of the <i>jaman buda</i>, claiming
amends from succeeding creeds, received little from
Islām and absolutely nothing from Christianity.
Under Dutch rule very few attempts at style in
Java and the other islands of the Malay Archipelago
have been made at all, and of these few only one
has resulted in an achievement not altogether
ridiculous, namely the old town-hall, begun in 1707
and finished in 1710, of old Batavia, where the
Resident has his office, by the natives very appropriately
called <i>rumah bichara</i>, <i>i.e.</i> “house of talk”.
With one or two utterly tasteless exceptions, the
rest of the Government and private buildings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
including the palaces of the Governor-General at
Weltevreden and Buitenzorg, descend in their architecture
to the lowest grade of the commonplace. To
his Excellency’s ill-kept country-seat in the Preanger
subverted Mojopahit seems almost preferable, notwithstanding
the squalor of its threadbare <i>kaïn klambu</i>
decoration; the meanness of the viceregal reception-
and living-rooms at Chipanas is not even picturesque
and surely some of the public money regularly paid
out for the maintenance of the “Government hotels”
might be profitably expended on the improvement
of the surroundings of Her Majesty the Queen of
the Netherlands’ representative in the Dutch East
Indies, including the rickety furniture, shabby
napery, etc., which has a pitiful tale of unseemly
parsimony to tell: the superiority of high rank
needs decorum and nowhere more than in oriental
countries, a truth lately too much lost sight of by
officials, high and low, who, following the example
set at Buitenzorg, hoarding against the hour of their
demission, presume on their “prestige” without
anything to back it.</p>

<p>Mojopahit had ceased to exist and the Muhammadans
with the Christians in their wake overran
Java, despoiling the land in which toleration and
art could no more flourish, but dissension throve as
the tree prophetically imaged at the Boro Budoor,
whose branches bear swords and daggers instead of
wholesome, luscious fruit. The old quarrels over
political supremacy were surpassed in violence by
religious strife, and fanaticism is still held responsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
in our day for disturbances conveniently ascribed
to Moslim cussedness when the acknowledgment of
the real cause, discontent born from over-taxation,
would be tantamount to a confession of administrative
impotence. It was not Hanoman, the deliverer of
Sita, who troubled the repose of Ravana’s garden,
but the <i>raksasas</i> and <i>raksasis</i> who kept her in bonds,
and there are two solutions of the Dutch East Indian
problem, independent of the issue celebrated in the
<i>Ramayana</i> and both suggested in the ornament of
Java’s temples: the devourer Time destroying all
with his sharp teeth, and the lion, or tiger, to
preserve the local colour, master of the fleeting
moment, with a garland of flowers in his mouth,
image of the clouded present holding out the promise
of a brighter future. The two auguries, dark yet
hopeful, belong to one old order of ideas, prefiguring
things to come in dubious language, after the wont
of oracles, ancient and modern, and we can choose
the forecast which likes us best. So did the princes
of Daha, Tumapel and Mojopahit, not to mention
the lesser fry, creatures of a breath as we deem
them now, doughty warriors and far-seeing statesmen
to their contemporaries, who consulted their
soothsayers before treading the fields of fame and
blood whence they were carried to their graves,
admiring nations rearing the mausoleums which
now constitute the greater part of the historic
monuments of East Java. The <i>Pararaton</i> mentions
no fewer than seventy-three structures of that
description. Such as have been left are, for various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
reasons, hard to classify, the greatest difficulty
arising from their bad state of preservation, though
deciphered dates furnish important clues, for instance
regarding some <i>chandis</i> in Kediri: Papoh (1301),
Tagal Sari (1309), Kali Chilik (1349), Panataran
(1319-1375),<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> the last named being probably the
principal tomb of the dynasty of Mojopahit. Springing
from the soil in amazing dissimilitude, their
architects seeking new modes of expression in new
forms and never hesitating at any oddity, at any
audacity to proclaim the message of artistic freedom
from convention, they struggled free from the sober
lines and harmonious distribution of spaces always
maintained in Central Java, to run riot in fantastic
innovations. Yet, they held communion with nature
and neither shirked their responsibility nor sinned
against the proper relations between their purpose
and the visible consummation of their task as those
of our modern master-builders do who contrive
churches like barns or cattle-sheds, stables like
gothic chapels, prisons like halls of fame and cottages
like mediaeval donjons. From such architectural
absurdities it is pleasant to turn, <i>e.g.</i>, to the <i>chandi</i>
Papoh, a temple whose corner-shrines might pass
for daintily wrought golden reliquaries inlaid with
jewels, when the minute detail of their exquisite
decoration is shone upon by the setting sun; or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the <i>chandi</i> Sangrahan, when warmed to life from
death and fearful decay, by the blue of a measureless
sky, again budding from the earth, lovely as the
lotus in the bliss bestowing hand of one of the five
finely chiselled but headless statues near by.</p>

<p>Holiness in East Java, as everywhere in the
island, took naturally to bathing. The retreat
Bookti in the district Rembes, set apart for that
pastime, according to the legend by Semu Mangaran,
first king of Ngarawan (the later Bowerno and still
later Rembang), had and has many rivals, nearly all
in possession of antiquities to show their sacred
character and the regard in which they were held.
Some, like Bookti and Banyu Biru, the deservedly
popular “blue water” of Pasuruan, are enlivened by
colonies of monkeys, descendants of the apes kept
there in Hindu times, beggars by profession, whose
antics reap a rich reward. Sarangan in Madioon,
Trawulan and Jalatoonda in Surabaya, Jati Kuwoong
and Panataran in Kediri, Ngaglik and Balahan in
Pasuruan, shared in olden times the renown which
now is principally divided between Banyu Biru and
Wendit, not to forget Oombulan, delightful spots,
typical of a land where life is a continuous caress.
Ngaglik has a beautiful female statue, evidently
destined to do service as a fountain-figure after the
manner of the nymphs which grace John the
Fleming’s<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Fontana del Nettuno in Bologna and
countless other waterworks of his and the succeeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
period. Wendit has Sivaïte remains: the prime
god’s <i>nandi</i>, statues of Doorga, Ganesa, etc.; most
of the <i>lingas</i> and <i>yonis</i> that used to keep them
company as reminders of their inmost nature, have
been carried off. Banyu Biru has a statue of
Doorga, <i>raksasas</i>, fragments of Banaspatis, etc., and
a very remarkable image of Ganesa with female
aspect, an object of veneration, especially on Friday
evenings when flowers and copper, even silver coins
are strewn round to propitiate his dual spirit, candles
are lighted and sweetmeats offered to the ancient
deities taken collectively. The <i>chandis</i> Jalatoonda
and Putri Jawa served a double purpose: devotion
and ablution, facilities for an invigorating bath
playing a prominent part. The former, in the
district Mojokerto, residency Surabaya, is the
mausoleum of King Udayana, father of King
Erlangga, and one of the oldest monuments in East
Java; the latter, in the district Pandakan, residency
Pasuruan, has much in common, as to ornament,
with the <i>chandi</i> Surawana of the year 1365 and
belongs on the contrary to the younger products
of Hindu architecture. <i>Chandi</i> Putri Jawa means
“temple of the Javanese princesses”, and Ratu
Kenya, the Virgin Queen of Mojopahit (1328-1353),
who spoiled her reputation for chastity by losing
her heart to a groom in her stables and making him
share her throne, as the <i>Damar Wulan</i> informs us,
may have repaired thither with her ladies-in-waiting
to sacrifice and disport in the swimming-tank which
is still replenished with water from the neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
river, flowing through the cleverly devised conduits;
or the women of her luckless last successor, King
Bra Wijaya, may have taken their pleasure there
along with their devotional exercises before the
Moslim torrent swamped their lord and master’s
high estate, harem and all.</p>

<p>Cave temples have been found in Surabaya
(Jedoong), in Besuki (Salak) and in Kediri (Jurang
Limas and Sela Mangleng). The latter, of greatest
interest and Buddhist in character, can be divided
into pairs: Sela Baleh and Guwa Tritis, Joonjoong
and Jajar. They are easily reached from Tuloong
Agoong and, though the removable statuary is
gone, except the heavy <i>raksasas</i>, defaced figures on
pedestals, etc., the sculpture of the interior walls of
the caves remained in a tolerable state of preservation.
Above on the ridge is a spot much resorted
to for meditation and prayer, where the view of the
charming valley of the Brantas, bounded by the
beetling cliffs of the south coast, the treacherous
Keloot to the northeast and the majestic Wilis<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> to
the northwest, prepares the soul for communion
with the Spirit of the Universe. Remains of brick
structures abound in East Java; besides the ruins
of Daha and Mojopahit we have, for instance, the
walls of the Guwa Tritis under the jutting Gunoong
Budek, the <i>chandis</i> Ngetos at the foot of the Wilis,
Kali Chilik near Panataran, Jaboong in Probolinggo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and Derma in Pasuruan. The <i>chandi</i> Jaboong
presents a remarkable instance of tower-construction
applied to religious buildings in Java as
further exemplified, conjointly with terraces, in the
<i>chandi</i> Toompang. The surprises offered by the
<i>chandi</i> Derma are no less gratifying, firstly to
travellers in general who visit Bangil and, approaching
the temple, which remains hidden to the last
moment, suddenly come upon it in an open space
adapted to full examination; secondly to archaeologists
in particular because, dating from the reign
of Mpu Sindok (850 Saka or before) and therefore
one of the oldest monuments in East Java, if not
the oldest in a recognisable state of preservation, it
must be accepted as the prototype of Javanese
architecture bequeathed by Old Mataram and is a
valuable help to the study of the ancient builders’
technique, showing, among other things, says Dr.
Brandes, that the larger ornamental units are of one
piece of terra-cotta, joined to the masonry by means
of tenons and mortises.</p>

<p>About a mile to the southeast of Malang, on the
top of a hill near the <i>kampong</i> Bureng, are traces
of more buildings constructed in brick, the ruins
of Kota Bedah. The foundation of that city is
attributed to a son of Gajah Mada, chief minister of
the last king of Mojopahit who, after his master’s
fall, fled eastward and, subjecting Singosari with
adjoining territories, became the progenitor of the
dynasty of Supit Urang. The Moslemin pushing
on and harassing the Saivas wherever met, invested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Kota Bedah but, not prevailing against the strong
defence of its commander Ronga Parmana, they
caught the citizens’ pigeons which flew over their
camp and, attaching pieces of burning match-rope to
the birds’ wings and tail-feathers, they set fire to the
thatch of the houses within the walls and so gained
their end. Thereupon they destroyed the royal
residence Gedondong, to the east of Malang, and
those of Supit Urang took refuge in the Tengger
mountains. This is one of several traditions explaining
the existence of Sivaïte remains scattered
in that neighbourhood: at Dinoyo, Karanglo,
Singoro, Katu, Pakentan, etc. On the road to
Toompang stands the <i>chandi</i> Kidal, one of the best
preserved in Java, only the upper part of the roof
having fallen down. It is the mausoleum of
Anusapati, the Hamlet of Javanese history, referred
to in the preceding chapter, who was killed in 1249
by his step-brother. His likeness has been sought
in an image of Siva, on the supposition that some
statues of deities there erected, which point to
the use of living models, represent the features of
exalted personages. An enormous Banaspati over
the entrance with smaller ones over the niches,
<i>garudas</i> and lions form the principal decoration in
frames of highly finished ornament. Dr. Brandes
remarks that in contrast to the decoration of the
temples in Central Java, the heavy ornament of the
relief-tableaux is here distributed over the parts
which carry the weight of the superstructure, while
the lighter ornament finds employment on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
panels and facings. The methods of construction
and the treatment of details mark clearly a transition
to the younger period of eastern Javanese architecture
best illustrated by the <i>chandi</i> Panataran.</p>

<div class="caption">XVI. <i>CHANDI</i> SINGOSARI<br />(Archaeological Service through Charls and van Es.)</div>
</div>

<p>Somewhat older, built in 1278 as a mausoleum
for Kertanegara, the last king of Tumapel, who
reigned from 1264 to 1292 and was killed in battle
by Jaya Katong, King of Daha, is the <i>chandi</i>
Singosari, near the railway station of that name, an
excellent starting-point for an ascension of the fire-mountain
Arjuno or Widadaren. It has been called
one of the most unfortunate monuments in the
island; not, presumably, because it shared the
common lot, being gradually deprived of its finest
ornament while its stones were freely disposed of
for building material without the local authorities
minding in the least, but because the spoliation
could be watched by a comparatively large number
of planters and industrials, settled in the neighbourhood,
none of them interfering unless to its detriment.
Insurmountable difficulties of transportation opposed
the removal of the colossal <i>raksasas</i> and so they
were left with a <i>nandi</i>, a sun-carriage and, among
fragments too defaced for recognition, a Ganesa
and a female Buddhist saint, for this temple-tomb is
of a mixed character in its religious aspect. A
Javanese chronicle relates that Kertanegara was
buried at Singosari in 1295, three years after his
death, in the guise of Siva-Buddha, and at Sakala
conformably to a more pronounced Buddhist rite.
He was considered a wise ruler, notwithstanding his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
abusive attitude towards China, which had such
dire results. He built an edifice, continues the
<i>babad</i>, divided into two parts, the lower one Sivaïtic,
the upper one Buddhistic, because in his life
he prided himself on being a Saiva as well as
a Buddhist. A richly ornamented <i>kala</i>-head in
eastern Javanese style testifies to the admirable
technique of the builders and decorators. According
to popular belief a subterranean passage leads from
Singosari to Polaman, about six miles away, a place
of sacrifice in Hindu days, and another to Mondoroko,
close by, the site of a ruin with a graceful statue of
a female deity, two smaller ones which remind the
beholder of Siva’s and Doorga’s creative faculties,
and sadly damaged bas-reliefs. In 1904 an inscribed
stone was recovered, at the intimation of a native,
from a pond near Singosari. Confirming the data
furnished by the Javanese chronicles, the inscription
states that in 1351 Gajah Mada, the Prime Minister
of Mojopahit, acting for King Wisnuwardhani,
founded a temple-tomb, sacred to the memory of
the priests, Saivas and Buddhists, who, in the year
1292, had followed their King Kertanegara in death,
and of the old Prime Minister who had been killed
at his feet.... “See here the foundation of the
most honourable Prime Minister of Java’s sea-girt
domain.”</p>

<div class="caption">XVII. <i>CHANDI</i> TOOMPANG<br />(Archaeological Service through Charls and van Es.)</div>
</div>

<p>Finest and most interesting of the Malang
complex is the <i>chandi</i> Jago, about twelve miles to
the east of the capital of the assistant-residency, in
the <i>aloon aloon</i> of Toompang and hence more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
commonly named <i>chandi</i> Toompang. It was the first
taken in hand by the Commission appointed in 1901
and we owe most of the information, summarised in
the following lines, to Dr. Brandes’ reports on this
archaeological debut. A rare example of tower-construction
of the kind also observed in the <i>chandi</i>
Jaboong, superposed on a raised level reached by
terraces like those of the <i>chandis</i> Panataran and
Boro Budoor, the extraordinary Javanese mixture of
Sivaïsm and Buddhism with a dash of Vishnuïsm
has affected it to such a degree that even a recent
description declares it to be a Buddhist pit-temple&mdash;a
contradiction in terms. Begun in the middle of
the thirteenth century, <i>i.e.</i> in the time of Tumapel’s
political ascendency when Sivaïsm was the state
religion, if we may speak of a state religion among
peoples and princes whose predominant article of
faith was tolerance and concession of equal rights
to all religions, some of the learned investigators
suppose with Professor Speyer that the Buddhist
note was a consequence of the persecution of the
adherents of Gautama’s creed in India and the
hospitality extended to the emigrants all over the
island Java. However this may be, syncretism
became rampant in both the ground-plan and the
decoration of the <i>chandi</i> Toompang, conceived as
an elevated dodecagonal structure on the highest of
three irregularly shaped terraces, something quite
exceptional in Javanese architecture. Apparently
while the building was in progress, remarks Rouffaer,
changes were made in the original project, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
more is the pity that the temple proper has fallen
into almost complete ruin: not only that the roof is
lacking, but the toppling back wall has dragged the
greater part of the north and south walls down with
it. The front or west wall has held out to a certain
extent with the gateway, the chief entrance, a lofty,
rectangular, monumental passage, ornamented on
both sides and locked with a key-stone whose smooth
middle space was destined, in the opinion of Dr.
Brandes, to receive, but never did receive, the date
of completion. Heaps of debris round about lead
to the conjecture that the whole was encircled by a
wall of brick and that the dwellings of the keepers
or officiating priests were composed of the same
material.</p>

<p>Several of the bas-reliefs fortunately escaped
destruction and found an interpreter in Dr. Brandes,
to whom we also owe explanations of the stereotyped
decorative scrolls and flourishes. Though inferior
in workmanship to the reliefs of Panataran, those of
Toompang, “speaking” reliefs as he called them,
are vigorously animated, gaining in interest to the
devotee as he ascends the terraces, their masterly
treatment culminating in what has been preserved
on the portion still standing of the temple-walls.
No better illustration of high and low life, of the
nobility and the riff-raff portrayed in classic Javanese
literature, could be imagined; the typical perfect
knights and sly buffoons are there in crowds, princes
and courtiers, warriors and peasants, gallivanting
beaux and love-sick maidens, jealous husbands and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
frisky wives, worldwise sages and babbling fools,
Javanese Don Quijotes riding out with their trusty
squires of the Sancho Panza species, go-betweens
neither better nor worse than Celestina, entangling
dusky Melibeas. Every honourable soul
is set off by his or her vulgar counterpart, of the
earth earthy: the <i>panakawan</i> (page) and the <i>inya</i>
(nurse) play most important rôles, almost equally
important with those of the hero and heroine, and
their characters are, conformably to the requirements
of Javanese literature, clumsy and coarse but droll;
their actions, whether they accomplish or fail to
accomplish their tasks, reflect the performances of
the born ladies and gentlemen whom they accompany,
who lose each other and are reunited, who quarrel
and make up, always in a comely, stately way,
proud and sensitive, expressing their feelings in
graceful gestures corresponding with the choicest
words. When treating of Panataran, the ornamentation
of the ancient monuments of East Java in its
relation to Javanese literature will be more fully
discussed. Here, however, belongs a reference to
Dr. Brandes’ ingenious explanation of the slanting
stripes or bars, left uncarved at irregular intervals on
the narrow tiers of bas-reliefs at the <i>chandi</i> Toompang;
comparing those sculptured bands with the
<i>lontar</i><a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> leaves on which the tales, whose illustration
they furnish, were originally written, he saw in
them the finishing strokes of the different chapters.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>
<p>The statuary of the <i>chandi</i> Toompang has been
removed, for the greater part, to the Museum at
Batavia and, possibly, one or two images, with
Professor Reinwardt’s invoice of 1820, to that of
Leyden. The deities are brilliantly executed, of
idealistic design, to borrow Rouffaer’s words,
exuberant to the point of effeminacy. Some of
them show the conventional Hindu type and we
can imagine the wonderful effect they produced
among the essentially Javanese scenes chiselled on
the walls. For their inscriptions Nagari characters
have been used, a circumstance adduced to prove
the predominant Buddhist significance of this
temple. The principal statue seems to have been
the decapitated and otherwise damaged, eight-armed,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
colossal Amoghapasa, Lord of the World,
reproduced by Raffles, including the head, “carried
to Malang some years ago by a Dutchman,” he
informs us, which, symbolic of unity with Padmapani,
displays Amitabha, the Dhyani Buddha of the
West, the Buddha of Endless Light, in the manner
of a frontal. The goddess Mamakhi, scarcely less
beautifully cut and also reproduced by Raffles in his
<i>History of Java</i>, was carried to England <i>in tota</i>
by himself. Efforts to trace her whereabouts have
not met with success; she remains more securely
hidden, probably in one of the store-rooms of the
British Museum, than the stone with inscription
recording an endowment, transported from Java to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the grounds of Minto House near Hassendean,
Scotland. Talking of carrying away: a little to
the southeast of the <i>chandi</i> Toompang stood a
temple of which hardly a stone has been left; a little
to the south of the <i>chandi</i> Singosari another is
visibly melting into air. The Chinese community
at Malang, as Dr. Brandes informed the Batavian
Society of Arts and Sciences, boast of a permanent
exhibition of Hindu statuary and ornament, consisting
of more than 160 numbers, gathered together
in the neighbourhood and on view in their cemetery.
Baba collects Sivaïte and Buddhist antiquities with
great impartiality, subordinating religious scruples
to practical considerations, as when he lights his
long-stemmed pipe at one of the votive candles on
the altars in his places of worship. Excellent
opportunities for the study of Chinese influences on
Javanese art are offered by the decoration of his
temple in Malang with its motives derived from
creeping, fluttering, running, pursuing and fleeing
things: tigers, deer, dragons, bats, especially bats,
shooting up and down, flitting off, swiftly turning
back, circling and scudding. The mural paintings
of a good many other <i>klentengs</i>, too, are of more
than passing interest since they promote a right
understanding of the development of the Greater
Vehicle of the Law, which in Java exchanged
fancies and notions with both Chinese Buddhism
and Taoïsm, discarded the classic for the romantic,
if the expression be permissible in this connection,
and still continues to live among the island’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
inhabitants of Mongolian extraction, as Sivaïsm
among the Balinese, their creative thought moulding
old fundamental ideas in unexpected new forms.
If Buddhism brought new elements into Chinese
art, stimulating ideals and religious imagery, as the
Count de Soissons remarks,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> leading, for instance,
to sublime personifications of Mercy, Tenderness
and Love, the debt is repaid and emigrating
Chinese decorators shower the graces of their
benign goddess Kwan Yin on their labours in
distant climes. As to Java, with which China
entertained relations from the remotest Hindu
period, they animated and reshaped in endless
variation the ornament they found, the <i>makaras</i>,
the <i>kala</i>-heads, at last, in their <i>saï-shiho</i> tracery,
being gradually supplanted by the bat-motive.</p>

<div class="caption">XVIII. <i>CHANDI</i> PANATARAN<br />(Archaeological Service through Charls and van Es.)</div>
</div>

<p>The <i>chandi</i> Panataran is the most beautiful, for
many reasons also the most remarkable temple in
East Java and, with the exception of the Boro
Budoor, the largest in the whole island. It was
discovered by the American explorer Thomas
Horsfield. Its foundations and the interior of its
sepulchral pit are constructed in brick; its terraces
are in general design not unlike those of the <i>chandi</i>
Toompang; among its statues, stolen and scattered
far and wide, it may have contained images of
Buddhist purport and inspiration. Sivaïtic in
aspect, however, as it stands now, it is the only one
of the monuments in Kediri sufficiently preserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
to determine its religious origin. Fergusson classes
the <i>chandi</i> Panataran with the tree- and serpent-temples
whose most peculiar feature in the
residencies Malang and Kediri consists in having
“a well-hole in the centre of their upper platform,
extending apparently to their basement,” and the
suggestion occurring to him “as at all likely to
meet the case, (is) that they were tree-temples, that
a sacred tree was planted in these well-holes, either
in the virgin soil, or that they were wholly or
partially filled with earth and the tree planted in
them.” He compares the <i>chandi</i> Panataran with
the Naha Vihara or Temple of the Bo-tree in Ceylon
and bases its claim to being called a serpent-temple
on the fact that “the whole of the basement moulding
is made up of eight great serpents, two on each
face, whose upraised breasts in the centre form the
side-pieces of the steps that lead up to the central
building, whatever that was. These serpents are
not, however, our familiar seven-headed Nagas that
we meet with everywhere in India and Cambodja,
but more like the fierce, crested serpents of Central
America.” So far Fergusson; but the well or pit,
notwithstanding the veneration of which the bo-tree
was the object, seems rather to have been a
receptacle for the ashes of the princes of Mojopahit
whose memory the founder of this mausoleum,
probably Queen Jayavisnuvardhani, the above-mentioned
Ratu Kenya, immortalised in the <i>Damar
Wulan</i>, intended to perpetuate. The <i>raksasas</i>,
guardians of the ruins of the principal structure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
bear the date 1242 Saka (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1320); a minor temple
and terrace give the dates 1369 and 1375, from
which it has been concluded that they were added
in the reign of Ratu Kenya’s son Hayam Wurook.</p>

<p>The edifice rose from a square base and large
statues of Siva as Kala adorn the feet of the staircases
which lead to the first and second terrace. Of
the temple proper not a stone is left; the walls of
pit and terraces are covered with sculpture, a sort
of griffins on the highest, scenes from the <i>Ramayana</i>
and illustrations of other popular poems and fables
on the lower ones, beautiful work but irreparably
damaged by official bungling. As if the apathy
which suffered this noble monument to be despoiled
and the providentially undemolished parts to
crumble away, had not done enough harm, an
amateur invested with local authority conceived a
plan of restoration and preservation on official lines,
that beat even the methods of the art-connoisseurs
of the chain-gang to whom the care for the
antiquities at Jogjakarta is entrusted, which would
make reconstruction impossible for all time to come
and deface the ornament in the thoroughest possible
way. In obedience to a Government resolution of
June 22, 1900, Nr. 18, the Batavian Society of Arts
and Sciences having been consulted with a view to
save the <i>chandi</i> Panataran from further decay, the
Contrôleur in charge of the administrative division
within whose boundaries it is situated, engaged
native masons who, following their instructions,
cemented, plastered and whitewashed to the tune of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
fl. 989.10 (about £82) with the magnificent result
that the upper terrace has been transformed into a
thickly plastered reception-bower for picnic parties;
that everything has received a neat coat of whitewash
to rejoice the hearts of housewives out for the
day with their husbands, little family and friends;
that the architectural detail has been hidden under
solid layers of mortar and cement. Plaster, whitewash
and cement everywhere: the noses and other
extremities of the scanty statuary still in place but
injured by time and hand of man, have been touched
up with it; from top to bottom it has been smeared
over whatever could be reached, making the
venerable old temple hideously ridiculous&mdash;an
orgy of “conservation” in the pernicious official
acceptance of the word, hoary age being ravaged
by cheap, destructive “tidying up”. This is how
the theory of Government solicitude for the ancient
monuments of Java works out in practice.</p>

<p>It must be considered a miracle or evidence of
the native masons possessing a higher developed
artistic sense than their employer, that the bas-reliefs
have suffered less than this extraordinary
process of restoration and preservation portended,
though much detail has been destroyed, thanks to
their vandalism under orders from Batavia as understood
by the Philistine of Blitar. In the first place
we find again, divided by medallions with representations
of animal life, a sculptural delineation of the
<i>Ramayana</i>, the artist’s buoyant fancy, blending the
celestial with the human, shedding a divine light on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
acts of most common daily occurrence by making
gods and semi-gods partake of man’s estate in deeds
sublimely natural. The <i>Ramayana</i> was a great
favourite for the decoration of temples, as proved
by the <i>chandis</i> Panataran, Toompang, Surawana
and Prambanan; the <i>Mahabharata</i> or, rather, its
Javanese version, the <i>Brata Yuda</i>, came as a good
second; the <i>Arjuno Wiwaha</i> of the poet Mpu
Kanwa has been put to use for the embellishment
of the <i>chandis</i> Surawana and Toompang; the
<i>Kersnayana</i> for that of the <i>chandis</i> Toompang and
Panataran. We might do worse and, in fact, we
are doing worse with our insipid epitaphs and
tasteless lapidary pomposity in our cemeteries,
than adorn the tombs of our great departed with
imagery taken from our poets, tellers of good tales
and fabulists, the life they knew so well aiding us
to fathom death with its mysteries and promises.
The promise most cherished by the Hindu Javanese
was that personified in Siva: death to make new
life grow and increase in beauty among mortals
feeding on happiness, by reason of Kala’s breath
destroying the misery of tottering old age, raising
man to equality with the gods. That is what the
people, for whom the marvellous ancient monuments
of Java were built, loved to read in the masterpieces
of their literature, carved for their benefit on the
mausoleums of their kings, heeding the wise lessons
for whoso chooses to reflect, of their <i>Canterbury
Tales</i>, <i>Faerie Queene</i>, <i>Paradise Lost</i> and <i>Paradise
Regained</i>; their <i>Narrenschiff</i>, <i>Dil Ulenspigel</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
<i>Faust</i>; their <i>Divina Commedia</i> and <i>Decameron</i>;
their <i>Romancero del Cid</i> and <i>Conde Lucanor</i>; their
<i>nouvelles</i> and <i>joyeux devis</i>, their <i>vies très horrifiques</i>
of their Gargantuas and Pantagruels. Life in their
thought being intimately connected with death,
which consequently inspired nothing of the abject
terror the practice of western Christianity clothes it
with, in curious contrast to the saving hope of its
eastern origin, we discern cheerfulness, the effect of
serene meditation, the true <i>amrita</i>, the rejuvenating
nectar of self-existent immortality, as the keynote
also to sensible earthly existence in the infinitely
varied forms inviting our examination on the walls
of the <i>chandi</i> Panataran. <i>Greift nur hinein ins
volle Menschenleben!</i> If the beholder be a philosopher
or an artist, or both, desirous to grasp the full
life of man, he will receive rare instruction; and if a
<i>lustige Person</i> as well, joy will accrue to him from
the sempiternal relevancy of Javanese allegorical
humour, at times almost prophetic: the sculptor
of the pigheaded but self-satisfied peasant who
cultivates his land with a plow drawn by crabs,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
must have had a vision of the Dutch Government
endeavouring, after periodical visitations of worse
than customary want, misery and famine, to secure
progress and prosperity in the island by appointing
long commissions with long names, toiling long years
over long reports that leave matters exactly where
they were.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>
<p>The skies in the scenery of the bas-reliefs on the
lowest terrace of the <i>chandi</i> Panataran have something
very peculiar, termed cloud-faces by Dr.
Brandes, who recognised in the fantastic forms of
the floating vapour as reproduced in the hard stone,
demons and animals to which he drew special
attention: a <i>kala</i>-head, a furious elephant threatening
to charge, etc. The figures of all bas-reliefs,
mostly perhaps those of the second tier from below,
are notable for their departure from the smooth
treatment generally accorded to Javanese sculpture
of the period and best defined perhaps in the phrase
of one of Canova’s critics when he derided that
artist’s “peeled-radish” style. Angular and flat,
they remind one of the <i>wayang</i>-puppets, and the
obvious correspondence between the manner in
which the <i>chandi</i> Panataran illustrates some of the
chief productions of Javanese literature and the performances
of the Javanese national theatre, has been
cleverly insisted upon by Rouffaer. The <i>wayang</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> the dramatic art of the island, sprang probably
from religious observances of pre-Hindu origin.
Dr. G. A. J. Hazeu<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> is of opinion that it formed
part of the ritual of the ancient faith, and even now
the <i>hadat</i> requires a sacrifice, the burning of incense,
etc., before the play commences. The Javanese
word <i>lakon</i>, a derivation from <i>laku</i>, which signifies
both “to run” and “to act”, applied to stage
composition, is the exact etymological equivalent of
our “drama”; the <i>lakon yèyèr</i> (<i>layer</i> or <i>lugu</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
confines itself to tradition, the <i>lakon karangan</i> to
subjects taken from tradition but freely handled, the
<i>lakon sempalan</i> to episodes from works otherwise
unsuitable because of their length. The <i>wayang</i>
appears, according to means of interpretation, as
<i>wayang poorwa</i> or <i>kulit</i>,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> <i>gedog</i>, <i>kelitik</i> or <i>karucil</i>,
<i>golek</i>, <i>topeng</i>, <i>wong</i> and <i>bèbèr</i>, of which the <i>wayang
poorwa</i> holds the oldest title to direct descent from
the ancestral habit of invocation of the spirits of
the dead. The epithet <i>poorwa</i> has been derived
from the <i>parwas</i> of the <i>Mahabharata</i> which, together
with the <i>Ramayana</i> and similar sources,
offered an abundant supply of dramatic material; it
is from the <i>wayang poorwa</i> that the Javanese people
derive their notions of past events, as the inhabitants
of another island did theirs from their poet and
playwright Shakespeare’s histories before eminent
actor-managers set to “improve” upon his work,
mutilating him on his country’s stage in the evolution
of a (fortunately more textual) interpretation,
pointedly designated as Shakespearian post-impressionism.</p>

<p>A <i>wayang poorwa</i> performance knows nothing of
the showy accessories devised by and for our histrions
to hide poverty of mentality and poorness of
acting, futile attempts to make up in settings, properties,
costumes and trappings, tailoring, millinery and
disproportionate finery what they lack in essentials.
The performer sits under his lamp behind a white,
generally red-bordered piece of cloth stretched over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
a wooden frame on which he projects the figures.
He speaks for them and intersperses explanations
and descriptions, directing the musicians with his
gavel of wood or horn, striking disks of copper or
brass to intimate alarums, excursions, etc. Formerly
all the spectators were seated before the screen, as
they still are in West Java, Bali and Lombok, but
gradually the men, separating from the women and
children, moved behind, so that in Central and East
Java they see both the puppets and their shadows.
The <i>wayang gedog</i>, much less popular than the
<i>wayang poorwa</i>, evolved from it in the days of
Mojopahit as Dr. L. Serrurier informs us; while
the latter draws its repertory principally from Indian
epics, the former with Raden Panji, Prince of
Jenggala, for leading hero, is more exclusively
Javanese and prefers the low metallic music of the
<i>gamelan pelog</i><a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> to that of the <i>gamelan salendro</i><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
with its high notes as of ringing glass. In the
<i>wayang kelitik</i> or <i>karucil</i>, of later invention and
never of a religious character, the puppets themselves
are shown: since <i>wayang</i> means “shadow”,
the use of that word is here, for that reason, less
correct, and the same applies to the <i>wayang golek</i> in
which the marionettes lose their spare dimensions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and become stout and podgy; to the <i>wayang topeng</i><a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
and <i>wong</i><a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> in which living actors perform, an innovation
not countenanced by the orthodox, who are
afraid that such deviations from the <i>hadat</i> may result
in dread calamities; and to the <i>wayang bèbèr</i> which
consists in displaying the scenes otherwise enacted,
in the form of pictures. Every one finds in the
<i>wayang</i>, of whatever description, an echo of his
innermost self: the high-born, smarting under a
foreign yoke, in the <i>penantang</i> (challenge and
defiance), the lowly in the <i>banolan</i> (farce), the fair
ones of all classes in the <i>prenesan</i> (sentimental,
gushing, spoony speech). It is a treat to look at
the natives, squatted motionless for hours and hours
together, their eyes riveted on the screen, listening
to the voice of the invisible performer, marvelling
at the adventures of the men and women who
peopled the <i>negri jawa</i> before them and faded into
nothingness, even the mightiest among them, whose
mausolea at Prambanan, Toompang, Panataran,
bear witness to the truth of those amazing deeds
of derring-do, love and hate, which will remain the
wonder of the world. To them the phantom-shadows
are reality of happiness in a dull, vexatious
life which is but the veil of death.</p>

<p>From Java, says Dr. Juynboll, the <i>wayang
poorwa</i> was transplanted to Bali, where it is still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
called <i>wayang parwa</i> and the puppets present a more
human appearance. Beside it thrives, especially
in Karang Asam, the <i>wayang sasak</i>, introduced from
Lombok and more Muhammadan in character,
whose puppets have longer necks after the later
Javanese fashion. Apart from such influences,
Balinese art, however, does not disown its Hindu-Javanese
origin. The inhabitants of the island,
with the exception of the <i>Bali aga</i>, the aborigines
in the mountains, different in many respects, pride
themselves on the name of <i>wong</i> (men of) Mojopahit
and adhere to the Brahman religion, though here
and there a few Buddhists may be encountered.
They are divided into castes and Sivaïte rites play
an important part in the religious ceremonial of the
upper classes. The common people have adopted
a sort of pantheism which makes them sacrifice in
the family circle to benevolent and malevolent spirits
of land and water, domiciled in the sea, rivers, hills,
valleys, cemeteries, etc. The village temples are
more specifically resorted to for propitiation of the
<i>jero taktu</i>, a superior being entrusted with the
guidance of commercial affairs and best approached
through the guardian of his shrine, who is held in
greater respect than the real priests. Every village
has also a house of the dead, consecrated to Doorga,
a goddess in high repute with those desirous to
dispel illness, to secure a favourable issue of some
enterprise, to learn the trend of coming events; the
heavenly lady enjoys in Bali a far wider <i>renommée</i>
than her lord and master Siva, who is honoured in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
six comparatively little-frequented temples. As to
the decadent architecture and excessive ornamentation<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
of the Balinese houses of worship, Dr. Brandes
considers both the one and the other a direct outcome
of the decay of the eastern Javanese style,
exemplified in the <i>chandis</i> Kedaton (1292), Machan
Puti,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Surawana and Tegawangi. The leading
ideas of the <i>chandi bentar</i> or entrance gate, and of
the <i>paduraksa</i> or middle gate, adduces Rouffaer, are
related respectively to those of the gate Wringin
Lawang at Mojopahit and of what the present day
Javanese call <i>gapura</i> in sacred edifices as old <i>kratons</i>,
old burial-grounds, etc.; and to those of the gate
Bajang Ratu, also at Mojopahit. These gates
Wringin Lawang and Bajang Ratu, states the
same authority further, can teach us moreover a few
things anent the architecture of the <i>puris</i> (palaces).
The temples and princely dwellings of Mataram
in Lombok were completely destroyed during the
inglorious war of 1894; the country-seat of
Narmada, however, a fine specimen of an eastern
pleasance, has escaped demolition. For how long?</p>

<p>In this respect it seems relevant to point to the
circumstance that the monuments of the smaller
Soonda islands, much more conveniently placed for
the unscrupulous spoiler because under less constant
observation of the general public, are exposed to
even greater danger than those in Java, Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
supervision counting for worse than nothing. A
Batavia paper denounced quite recently a traveller
who had been visiting the Dutch East Indies and,
armed with letters of recommendation from personages
of the highest rank and title in the Netherlands,
had been collecting curiosa and antiquities on a
vast scale only to advertise his collection for sale
as soon as unpacked after his return to Europe. It
contained carved ornament from temples, sacrificial
vessels and statuary from Bali, besides woven goods,
implements used in <i>batikking</i>, musical instruments,
<i>wayang</i>-puppets, etc. The profit attached to this
sort of globe-trotting is enormous, since the coveted
objects can be acquired for a mere song by taking
advantage of the influential assistance secured through
letters of recommendation over high-sounding names.
A hint from those in authority goes a very long
way with the docile native, in fact goes the whole
way of appropriation at a nominal value, and the big
official who left his post in the exterior possessions,
bound for home, also quite recently, with fifty boxes
of antique ware of a different kind, collected in his
residency, made certainly as good a haul as the
distinguished, brilliantly recommended tourist.</p>

<p>Although the theory of Gautama the Sugata’s life-story
being only a repolished solar myth has
broken down, its vital element of emancipation from
Brahmanic bonds is certainly much older than
Buddhism and the traditional Buddha but an
incarnation of ideas long germinating and attaining
fruition in his teachings, precisely as happened
with other religious reformers who came and went
before and after. The thirty-three gods of the
three worlds, “eleven in heaven, eleven on earth
and eleven dwelling in glory in mid-air,” with their
three supreme shining ones, Brahma, Vishnu and
Siva, creating, maintaining, destroying and creating
anew, began to pall on the human <i>trimoorti</i> of
brain, heart and bodily wants; the moral dispensa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>tion
on which the social edifice was founded, began
to need revision. Neither did the orthodox, at
first, refuse admittance to the spirit of emendation.
At the <i>sangharama</i><a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> of Nalanda the Vedas were
taught together with the Buddhist doctrine according
to the tenets of the Greater and the Lesser
Vehicle <i>à choix</i>. The Buddha had to be accepted
and was accepted equally by eastern tolerance and
western necessity; while ranking as a divine
teacher among his followers in the legendary
development of his precepts, he received honour
as an incarnation of Vishnu among the Hindus,
says Sir William W. Hunter,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> and as a Saint of
the Christian Church, with a day assigned to him
in both the Greek and Roman calendars. Truly,
the Hindus regarded him as the ninth and hitherto
last incarnation of Vishnu, the Lying Spirit let loose
to deceive man until the tenth and final descent of
the god, on the white horse, with a flaming sword
like a comet in his hand, for the destruction of the
wicked and the renovation of the world, but he was
reckoned with and acknowledged in their mythology,
and the remarkable conformity between Prince
Sarvarthasiddha’s lineage, adventures and achievements,
and those of the seventh <i>avatar</i> of the
Hindu deity in the <i>Ramayana</i> are certainly more
than accidental. The law of mercy to all, preached
by the blissful Bhagavat, the Buddha, the Saviour,
affected the Brahman creed profoundly; so pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>foundly
in its deductions, that apprehensive priests
resolved to extirpate Buddhist heresy. But since
religious persecution always defeats its purpose,
Buddhism throve with oppression and holds fully
its own against the two other great religions of
the present day, al-Islām and Christianity.</p>

<p>To define the Buddhism which, parallel and
entwined with Hinduïsm, preceded the Muhammadanism
of Java, is no easy matter, if it is possible
at all. For the sake of convenience Javanese
Buddhism may be classified as <i>mahayanistic</i>, conformable
to the northern canon or doctrine of the
Greater Vehicle, versus <i>hinayanistic</i>, <i>i.e.</i> conformable
to the southern canon or the doctrine of the
Lesser Vehicle. But the geographical division
proposed by Burnouf, hardly meets the case of our
more advanced knowledge, which points rather to
chronological distinctions. Javanese Buddhism of
the younger growth was strongly impregnated
with modified Brahmanic conceits,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> in fact a
compromise between the hopeful expectation of
the Metteya Buddha, the Messiah promised by
Bhagavat, and resignation to the decrees of the
Jagad Guru whom the Saivas of Hindu Java had
chosen for their <i>ishta-devata</i>, the fittest form in
which to adore the Ruler of the Universe, Param<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Esvara. Siva lost under Buddhist influences his
terrorising aspect as Kala, and the two creeds,
giving and taking, lived in perfect concord. The
statues of the Dhyani Buddhas partook of Siva’s
attributes; those of their sons, the Bodhisatvas, the
Buddhas in evolution, and of their <i>saktis</i>, showed the
characteristics of other Hindu gods and goddesses;
Siva, conversely, assumed the features of Avalokitesvara
or Padmapani, the Buddhist lord of the
world that is now. I have already spoken of the
enthroned Bodhisatvas represented at the Sivaïte
temples of Prambanan and the more or less Sivaïte
exterior of the Buddhist <i>chandi</i> Mendoot. Also
of this remarkable syncretism, born from inbred
tolerance, leading to new transactions with the
Islām, exacting as it may be everywhere else; of
the deference still shown to deities of the Hindu
pantheon in the shape of <i>jinn</i>; of the adjustment
of Muhammadan institutions to usages of Hindu
origin; etc. And Buddhism, doubtless, prepared
the mystically inclined mind of the Javanese
Moslim for the acceptance of the mild Sufism of
the school of Gazali, which guides him in submission
of will to <i>ma’ripat</i>, full knowledge, and
<i>hakakat</i>, most hidden truth, while he lacks the
conviction, to quote Professor L. W. C. van den
Berg, that his neglect of the prescribed daily
prayers will make him lose his status as a true
believer.</p>

<div class="caption">XIX. <i>CHANDI</i> KALASAN<br />(C. Nieuwenhuis.)</div>
</div>

<p>Central Java is richer yet in the quality than in
the quantity of its Buddhist monuments, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
builders and decorators, like the true artists they
were, told what they knew and believed, nothing
but that, and therefore told it so well.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> To examine
their work, beautiful even in decay, beginning with
the smaller structures, we wend our way again to
the plain of Prambanan. Travelling from Jogjakarta
to Surakarta by rail, the first stopping-place, reached
in about twenty minutes, is Kalasan, the <i>chandi</i> of
that name, otherwise called Kali Bening, being
visible from the train. Once it must have been one
of the finest and most elaborately wrought in the
island; now only the south front, nearly tumbling
down, witnesses to its former splendour. It was
built in 700 Saka (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 778), a date preserved in a
Nagari inscription which settles that point,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and
names a Shailandra prince as its founder in honour
of his <i>guru</i> (teacher), doing homage to Tara<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> who,
seeing the destruction of men in the sea of life,
which is full of incalculable misery, saves them by
three means ...; it speaks of a grant of land to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the monks of a neighbouring monastery, contains
several particulars of practical value with an admonition
to keep a bridge or dam in repair, etc. The
building, in the form of a Greek cross, had four
apartments, reached by a terrace and four staircases,
the stones of which have been carried away long
ago. The four gates, judging by the little left on
one of them, were profusely decorated with the
<i>kala-makara</i> motive dominating the ornament. The
roof bore images of Dhyani Buddhas in 44 niches
and was crowned with 16 dagobs so called, the
principal one rising probably to a great height.
Time and rapine have reduced this magnificent
realisation of a glorious conception, this masterpiece
of measured luxury, as Rouffaer styles it justly, to
a melancholy heap of debris. The statuary which
adorned the exterior is gone, save three images in
their niches, examples of the gorgeous but never
too florid ornamentation; the interior pictures
desolation, ruin within ruin! A disfigured elephant,
driven by a horned monster, its mahout, protrudes
from the wall above the throne it protects, but the
cushioned seat is empty. The statue taken from
it was presumably a representation of the beatific
Tara glorified in the inscription, the noble and
venerable one, whose smile made the sun to shine
and whose frown made darkness to envelop the
terrestrial sphere. It has been surmised that the
mysterious female deity in the residency grounds at
Jogjakarta originally filled the throne of Kalasan,
but the vanished Tara left her cushion behind and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the unknown goddess, whose lovely body rivals the
lotus-flower in august sweetness, holds firmly to her
<i>padmasana</i> in addition to her attributes defying
identification as the mother of the Buddha who
is to be.</p>

<p>The short distance between the <i>chandi</i> Kalasan
or Kali Bening and the <i>chandi</i> Sari must have been
often traversed by the seekers of the noble eight-fold
path, inquirers into the four truths and
examiners of the three signs, mortifiers of their flesh
in the practice of the ten repugnances. <i>Bikshus</i>,
living on the alms they collected without asking by
word or gesture, without unduly attracting attention,
passing in silence those inclined and those not inclined
to charity, avoiding the houses and people
dangerous to virtue, never tarrying anywhere and
never presenting themselves more than three times
at the doors of the uncharitable, eating the food
received in solitude before noon, the only meal
allowed to them, they must have awakened a good
deal of pity in their tattered robes, but one suspects
that the mendicant brethren of Java, notwithstanding
their individual vows of poverty, were exceedingly
wealthy as a community after the wont of their kind
everywhere and of whatever religious denomination.
Their <i>viharas</i> or monasteries, to judge from
the ruins, were well appointed and the inmates
apparently well provided for by princes who took a
pride or found their interest in befriending religion
and the religious. If strictly adhering to their
monastic rules, the Buddhist monks had to live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
in the open, but the wet monsoon is not a pleasant
season in the woods without adequate protection
against storm and rain, and <i>avec le ciel il y a des
accommodements</i>, a motto acted upon long before le
Sieur Poquelin formulated it. The <i>chandi</i> Sari is
supposed to have been the main structure of the
residential quarter destined for the accommodation
of the clergy connected with the <i>chandi</i> Kalasan,
the abode of the monks who knew the greater
vehicle of discipline as the inscription has it, the
monastery built by command of the Shailendra king
for their venerable congregation and recommended
to his successors in order that all who followed their
teachings might understand the cause and effect of
the positive condition of things and attain prosperity.
The rectangular building had a lower and an upper
storey, both divided into three rooms, lighted by
windows; the absent roof had niches for statuary,
capped with diminutive domes in the manner of
dagobs. In the decoration extensive use has been
made of the elephant and the <i>makara</i>, the fabulous
fish with an elephant’s head; images of saints with
and without aureoles, of celestial beings more
suggestive of the Hindu pantheon than of Buddhist
atheism,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> of the bird-people and divers animals,
enliven the rich, flowery ornament of the well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
proportioned facings, cornices and window-frames.
Rising gracefully from its solid yet elegant base, the
edifice creates an impression of airiness and stability
cleverly combined, the dark gray colour of the
weatherbeaten andesite blending harmoniously with
the tender green of the bambu-stools which transport
our thoughts to the garden of Kalandra where
the Buddha, preaching the lotus of the good law,
made converts foreordained to rank among his
most famous disciples: Sariputra, Maudgalyayana,
Katyayana.... And the officially licensed sinners
against the ancient monuments of Java, hardened,
habitual criminals in that respect, expressly appointed
to do their worst at the Paris Exhibition of 1900,
pretended their horrid botch in the Park of the
Trocadéro to be a reproduction <i>d’une pureté irréprochable</i>
of this rare gem of architectural workmanship,
the <i>chandi</i> Sari!</p>

<div class="caption">XX. <i>CHANDI</i> SARI<br />(C. Nieuwenhuis.)</div>
</div>

<p>As in India, pious foundations for the benefit of
those under bond to serve religion, disregarding
worldly considerations, must have been numerous
in Java, especially in the plain of Prambanan, once
studded with <i>viharas</i> like Asoka’s kingdom, the
“Behar” of to-day. Passing over the monastic
claims advanced for some ruins in the southern
mountains, those of Plahosan cannot be ignored.
There we find the remains of two buildings, formerly
enclosed by a wall, portions of which are recognisable,
and surrounded by smaller structures arranged
in three rows, the inner ones reminding of the style
conspicuous in the <i>chandi</i> Sewu, about a mile to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the west-southwest. Close together, but originally
perhaps divided by a second wall, they are situated
due north and south from each other with their
entrances to the west; the roofs have succumbed;
of the two storeys only the lower ones, containing
sufficient space for three rooms, are tolerably preserved.
Of a composite nature, the <i>chandi</i> Plahosan
was presumably rather a <i>sangharama</i> than a <i>vihara</i>
and the doorkeeper at the gate, when all those
scattered stones and the smashed, stolen or otherwise
removed statues were still in place, may have
welcomed the wayfarer, seeking shelter on a
tempestuous night, with such difficult questions as
barred access to the hospitality of Silabhadra, the
superior of Nalanda, and his flock. Hiuen Tsiang,
the Chinese pilgrim, who could answer them all
and a good many more, has left us a description of
the <i>sangharama</i>, the six consolidated <i>viharas</i> of
Nalanda with their towers, domes and pavilions,
embellished by the piety of the kings of the five
Indies; their gardens, splashing fountains and
shady groves, where he spent several years learning
Sanskrit and the wisdom of the holy books, never
thinking the days too long; their life of ease,
scarcely conducive to the austere observance of
pristine discipline by the ten thousand brethren
under vows and novices who crowded thither to
seek purification and deliverance from sin in study
and meditation,&mdash;a description which, for want of
any better, our fancy takes leave to apply to
Plahosan. Though separated by months of travel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
from Bodhimanda, where Sakyamuni entered the
state of the perfect Buddha and the proximity of
which gave Nalanda its holy character, the zeal
of its scholars and saints, no less tolerant than
Hiuen Tsiang’s temporary co-students, who sifted
with laudable impartiality the truth from the Vedas,
from the doctrines of the two vehicles and from the
heresies of the eighteen schismatics, undoubtedly
stimulated religious life in the best sense of the
word, religion disposing the mind to kindliness and
goodwill, as it should, strengthening social ties,
fostering science and art.</p>

<p>The walls of the <i>chandi</i> Plahosan, in so far as
preserved, are beautifully decorated with sculpture
in bas-relief. The delicate tracery of the basement
is divided by slender pilasters and the frieze
beneath the symmetric cornice is richly festooned,
parrots nestling in the foliage among the flowers.
Bodhisatvas, standing between, formed the principal
ornament of panels bordered by garlands with
pendent prayer-bells; the remaining ones grasp
lotus-stems springing up to their left; <i>gandharvas</i>
(celestial singers) float over the <i>garuda</i>-heads of the
portals. The reliefs represent scenes familiar to the
observer of native life: here a couple of men seated
under a bo-tree or <i>waringin</i> and saluting a person
of rank, raising their folded hands to perform the
<i>sembah</i>; there a <i>mās</i><a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> with his attendants, one of
whom holds the <i>payoong</i> (sunshade) over his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
while another carries a <i>senteh</i><a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> leaf. Four stone
figures guard the approaches to the <i>viharas</i>, armed
with cudgel and sword; in one hand they hold the
snake which, after the manner of their kind, should
be worn over one shoulder and across the breast,
replacing the <i>upawita</i>. The statuary which adorned
the inner rooms, was of large dimensions, finely
chiselled and garnished with profuse detail, concluding
from what we know of it. Part has been
removed to the “museum” at Jogja, part has been
broken to pieces by treasure-hunters who dug holes
and sunk shafts, disturbing the foundations of the
<i>chandi</i> Plahosan in their ignorance of the difference
between Buddhist monasteries and Hindu mausolea
built round funeral pits; the sorely damaged images
of holiness which were suffered to keep their
stations by frankly destructive and even more
pernicious official or semi-official <i>soi-disant</i> “preservation
and conservation,” are truly pitiful to
behold. It seems, indeed, as if the monuments
specially recommended to official care, are singled
out for the most irreparable injury. On a par with
the wild feast of plaster, cement and whitewash at
Panataran was the wonderful planning of a restoration
of the <i>chandi</i> Plahosan after faulty drawings
and the simultaneous disappearance of the staircase
and a portion of the substructure of the northern
<i>vihara</i>.</p>

<p>Less than a mile to the south of the stopping-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>place
Prambanan on the railroad from Jogja to Solo,
are the ruins of a group of <i>chandis</i> which may or may
not have borne a monastic character,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Sajiwan and
Kalongan being the names connected with it. One
of the structures was cleared in 1893 by the Archaeological
Society of Jogjakarta and to its statuary
applies what has been said of the atrocities perpetrated
at Plahosan: besides downright spoliation
the same errors of omission and commission. From
Prambanan proper, <i>i.e.</i> from the Loro Jonggrang
group, it is a short walk to the <i>chandi</i> Sewu, which
means the “thousand temples”. They are situated
in Surakarta, the boundary between the Susuhunan’s
and the Sooltan’s domains, indicated by two white
pillars, running just behind the smaller structures
which face the shrines of Brahma and Vishnu
flanking that of Siva. But, though the walk is
short, it may be a trifle too sunny for comfort even
if it be morning and the roads lively with the women
returning from market, the surroundings of the
houses of prayer and death gladdening the eye,
presenting a spectacle full of colour and light, the
matrons treading their way statelily and steadily,
the maidens, decorous and modest, gliding behind
their elders like the <i>devis</i>, the shining ones descended
from the <i>Ramayana</i> reliefs, to exhibit their exquisite
forms, bashful however conscious of their worth
in that golden, sweet-scented atmosphere. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
have no business at the <i>chandi</i> Sewu and on the
unfrequented by-path thither we proceed alone, save
for a few children with no more to cover their
nakedness than the loveliest innocence&mdash;a garment
quite different from the western <i>cache-misère</i> of
mawkish prudery&mdash;, curious to find out what the
strangers are about. Under their escort we reach
the <i>chandi</i> Loomboong (<i>padi</i>-shed), thus called from
the size and form of the ruins which compose it.
They are sixteen in number, arranged in a square
round the principal structure, its once octagonal
roof, shaped like a dagob, attesting to its Buddhist
character, though it is not unmixed with Sivaïte
elements as the funeral pits plainly indicate. They
were already empty when examined some years ago
and the fine statues tradition speaks of, can nowhere
be found. The little ornament left in place and
one single fragment of a bas-relief give a high idea
of the decoration when the beauty of these temples
had not yet faded away, exactly as in the case of
the <i>chandi</i> Bubrah,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> another shrine on the <i>via sacra</i>
which connects the Loro Jonggrang and Sewu
groups. To quote Major van Erp again: The
state of affairs here is very sad; of the <i>chandis</i>
Ngaglik, Watu Gudik and Geblak, which the
memory of the oldest inhabitants puts somewhat
farther north, even the site cannot now be located.</p>

<div class="caption">XXI. <i>RAKSASA</i> OF THE <i>CHANDI</i> SEWU<br />(Centrum.)</div>
</div>

<p>By the time we reach the thousand temples,
Surya, the sun-god, has driven his fiery carriage to
the zenith of his daily course through the air and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the fire-eyed <i>raksasas</i>, who guard the enclosure of
holiness; two for each of the four entrances, stretch
their gigantic limbs with dreadful menace in the
warm brilliancy of indefinite space, tangible terror.
Down on one knee to strike, snakes hanging from
their left shoulders as poisonous baldrics, they seem
to mark the transition between the worship of Kala,
quickening destruction personified, and the creed
which hails in death the portal to nirvanic nothingness,
the liberation from life’s miseries. Behind them
reigns the stillness of a tropical noon, subduing
heaven and earth to silent but intensely passionate
day-dreams. The kingly sun, the sun of Java, wide-skirted
Jagannath, having mounted to the summit
of the fleckless sky, pauses a moment before
descending, he, the light of the world, exciting to
generative emotion all that dwells below. The
fructifying charm of his touch is manifest in the
exuberant fertility of this island fortunate; in the
vitality of its people, unrestrained in creative
capacity by centuries of spoliation; in their mental
make-up, revealed in their history, their beliefs,
traditions and legends. The legend of the <i>chandi</i>
Sewu may be adduced as an instance in point,
though nothing but a different version of the legend
of the <i>chandi</i> Loro Jonggrang. One ancient effort
to account for architectural wonders deemed of
supernatural origin, by an explanation whose Indian
basic idea was transplanted from the fields of eastern
to those of western folk-lore too, serving at first,
perhaps, for all the monuments in the plains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Prambanan and Soro Gedoog, became the framework
of different tales adapted to the requirements
of different localities. Here it is the story of Mboq
Loro Jonggrang repeated, and her lover Raden
Bandoong Bondowoso is the son of the beautiful
Devi Darma Wati, daughter of Prabu Darmo
Moyo, king of the mighty empire of Pengging,
whose two brothers, Prabu Darmo Haji and Prabu
Darmo Noto, were kings respectively of Slembri and
Sudhimoro.</p>

<p>The <i>babad chandi Sewu</i> describes a public
function at the Court of Prabu Darmo Moyo, who
sits on his throne of ivory, inlaid with the rarest
gems. The <i>aloon aloon</i> outside swarms with his
warriors and while he pronounces judgment and
invests and displaces, ambassadors from Prambanan
are announced. They deliver a letter from Prabu
Karoong Kolo, in which the Boko, the giant-king,
asks Prabu Darmo Moyo’s daughter, Devi Darma
Wati, in marriage. The Princess, acquainted with
his suit, declares that she will marry no one but the
man, be he king or beggar, able to rede a riddle
which is given, written on a <i>lontar</i>-leaf, to the
ambassadors who thereupon depart. On their
arrival at Prambanan, Prabu Karoong Kolo breaks
impatiently the seal of the communication; learning
its meaning, his eyes dart flames, his mouth foams
and, tearing the <i>lontar</i>-leaf into pieces and trampling
upon it, making the earth tremble and disturbing
the sky with his noisy wrath, he collects his army
and marches against Pengging to raze the <i>kraton</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of Prabu Darmo Moyo and carry Darma Wati off.
The King of Pengging, warned of the approaching
danger, implores his brother Darmo Noto, King of
Sudhimoro, to assist him; with his brother Darmo
Haji, King of Slembri, an odious tyrant, he has
broken long ago. Prabu Darmo Noto orders his
son, the Crown Prince Raden Damar Moyo, to lead
his troops against the giant-king. Traversing the
woods at the head of his men, scaling cliffs and
climbing mountains, crossing rivers and ravines,
attacked by evil spirits and wild animals, Damar
Moyo, strenuous in the cause of his uncle and his
fair cousin, hastens to their defence but, leaving
every one behind, he loses his way and, tired out at
last, falls asleep. A strange sensation of heavenly
joy awakens him and, opening his eyes, he beholds
the supreme god, Bathara Naradha, who presents
him with the celestial weapons of the abode of the
immortals, Jonggring Saloko, salves his forehead
with the divine spittle to make him invulnerable
and invincible, and puts into his hand the flower
Sekar Joyo Kusumo which will enable him to rede
Devi Darma Wati’s riddle. Strengthened and more
enthusiastic than ever, Raden Damar Moyo, having
rejoined his army, engages the giants of Prambanan
and defeats them, astonishing friend and foe with
his acts of superhuman prowess. He redes the
riddle, marries Darma Wati, and his father-in-law,
Prabu Darmo Moyo, appoints him <i>senapati</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
commander-in-chief of the forces of Pengging.</p>

<p>The legend being too long for insertion in full,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
besides its containing details too candidly illustrative
of the generative emotion engendered by the wide-skirted
Jagannath, a summary of the events which
led to the foundation of the <i>chandi</i> Sewu must
suffice. Boko Prabu Karoong Kolo, King of
Prambanan, loses his life in another attempt at the
subjugation of Pengging, and Raden Damar Moyo,
having nothing more to fear from that side, but
naturally inclined to strife and contest, resolves to
take part in the wars then raging among the kings
of the Thousand Empires, Sewu Negoro. So
he leaves his wife and the son born to them,
Raden Bandoong, who grows into a comely youth.
Arriving at manhood and still in complete ignorance
of his sire’s name and lineage, the prince questions
his mother on that subject but, in obedience to an
express order from the gods, she refuses to tell him.
Vexed and suspicious, he equips himself from the
armoury of his grandfather, Prabu Darmo Moyo,
and eludes maternal vigilance, escaping from the
<i>kraton</i> in search of his father. After many
adventures, culminating in a conflict with his parent
in the Sewu Negoro, the two meeting and exchanging
hard blows and parting as strangers, he reaches
Prambanan, kills Tumenggoong Bondowoso, left in
charge of that realm, and falls in love with Devi
Loro Jonggrang, daughter of the late Boko Prabu
Karoong Kolo. But he has been forestalled in her
favour by his cousin Raden Boko, who is to become
her husband on condition of the overthrow of
Pengging and Sudhimoro. Suspecting a rival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
while maturing his plans for conquest, this Raden
Boko takes a mean advantage of the lady by a trick
learnt from a recluse who lends him a <i>tesbeh</i> (string
of prayer-beads) which possesses the power of transforming
its temporary owner into a white turtle-dove.
So disguised, he flies to the women’s quarter of the
<i>kraton</i> of Prambanan and attracts the attention of
Loro Jonggrang, who responds to the lovely bird’s
advances, puts it in her bosom and pets and fondles
it to her heart’s content until, alas! it is killed by
an arrow sped from the never erring bow of Raden
Bandoong, thanks to the busybodies of the palace
having informed him of the idyllic progressive
cooing. Woman-like, the bereaved Devi submits
to the inevitable after a period of passionate
mourning, and promises her heart and hand to the
stronger if not more dexterous suitor on condition
of his building a thousand temples in one night
between the first crowing of the cock and daybreak.
With the help of the gods of Jonggring Saloko he
accomplishes the task, but at the moment that he
whispers <i>astaga<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> chandi Sewu</i>, struck by the sight
of the moonlit plain blossoming into a city of
holiness, the immortals change him for his arrogant
prayer into a monster of horrible aspect. Woman-like
again, the Devi declines to keep her promise,
pleading that she engaged herself to a man and not
to a brute, and seeks refuge on the banks of the
river Opak. Frightened by the persecution of
Raden Bandoong, who tracks her from cave to cave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
she gives untimely birth to a daughter, the fruit of
her affection for turtle-doves, and dies. The brutal,
baffled lover still haunts the neighbourhood, which
therefore native mothers-to-be scrupulously avoid,
though it is not observed that the virgins derive
much instruction from the legend as far as concerns
the consequences of Devi or Mboq Loro Jonggrang’s
<i>amours</i> at an earlier stage.</p>

<p>From legendary lore we return to fact in the
matter of the foundation of the <i>chandi</i> Sewu by
taking cognisance of an inscription, <i>mahaprattaya
sangra granting</i> or <i>sang rangga anting</i>, unearthed
near one of its 246 (not thousand) temples,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> extolling
the munificence of the magnanimous Granting
or Anting. The style of writing justifies the
conjecture that the buildings date from about the
year 800 and are consequently of one age with the
Boro Budoor. If not erected by one architect at
the command of one bounteous prince, and the gifts
of several pious souls who possessed the wherewithal
for devotional works, they were at least constructed
according to one plan steadily kept in view, a good
deal more than can be said of many religious edifices
in western climes, which owe their existence less to
co-operative than to contentious piety. In respect
of area the largest of the temple groups in Java,
the first impression received from it is that of a
chaos of ruins, confusion being worse confounded
by the quarries opened here and there, and partly
filled again with earth and rubbish, while a luxuriant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
vegetation, regaining on the inroads of mattock and
pickaxe, quickly covers what they disturbed. Looking
closer, the separate shrines with their elaborate
tracery appear in the fiery embrace of the sun like
sparkling jewels, trembling with delight in the
luminous atmosphere beneath the immaculate sky;
the very marks of decay and ravaging time are beautiful;
the weeds clustering round the broken ornament,
the toppling walls, rouse to fanciful thought. No
sound is heard; nothing stirs while we make our
way to the principal structure, once lording it over
the smaller ones which stood squarely in four lines,
28 for the inner, 44 for the next, 80 for the third,
88 for the outer circumvallation. Excepting those
of the second row, their entrances faced inward and
amidst their scanty remains the foundations have
been uncovered of five somewhat larger ones: two
to the east, two to the west and one to the north;
like the outlying buildings, these are, with regard to
their superstructures, as if they never existed. Of
the terraces and staircases no other trace is left than
the telltale unevenness of the ground. The resemblance
in constructive methods between the <i>chandi</i>
Sewu and the <i>chandi</i> Prambanan strikes one at the
first glance; the same builders, it is surmised, strove
here to do for the Triratna<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> what there they did for
the Trimoorti; and if not the same, they discerned
equally the one truth bound up in the old creed and
the new, and expressed it with equal skill and
conviction in these twin litanies of stone&mdash;so the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
workers wrought and the work was perfected by
them.</p>

<p>The decorators in charge of the finishing touches,
embellished this city of temples with a wealth of
ornament which in the quivering glare of day,
despite ravage of time and pillage, clothes sanctity
in robes of encrusted winsomeness. The sculpture
of the <i>chandi</i> Sewu, says a visitor of a century ago,
is tasteful, delicate and chaste. Much of what he
based his judgment on, has since been carried
off or demolished, but what remains fully bears him
out: foliage and festoons, garlands and clustered
flowers, distributed over facings divided into
lozenges and circles by pilasters and fantastically
curved lines, with lions, tigers, cattle and deer in
ever varying abundance, awaken reminiscences of
the carvings which excited our admiration at
Prambanan and lead to the question: Did the
richly framed panellings of the twenty-four external
wall-spaces of the central temple exhibit scenes from
the epics and fable-books, besides this sumptuous
adornment, to match the almost uniform bas-reliefs
of the lesser structures? If so, they must have
rivalled the artistic excellence of the <i>Ramayana</i>
reliefs which beautify the shrines of Siva, Brahma
and Vishnu. And a second question arises: Was
the central temple the depository of a relic? In
connection with this query it deserves to be noticed
that, generally speaking and excepting statuary, the
internal wall-spaces of the <i>chandi</i> Sewu lack
ornament, evince a soberness in marked contrast to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the extravagant representations of the abode of
bitterness, as if sign- or house-painters had been
entrusted with the illustration of Dante’s <i>Inferno</i>,
repulsive attempts à la Wiertz minus the talent to
be admired in the Rue Vautier at Brussels, nightmares
of crude drawing and cruder colouring to
depict perverse torture, I found in eastern edifices
raised to satisfy priestly conventions, even in
Ceylon, the island of the doctrine that the Buddha
next to dwell on earth is the Metteya Buddha, the
Buddha of Kindness. More in harmony with the
soul’s yearning for his kingdom to come, is the lotus
motive happily adapted to the decoration of the
<i>chandi</i> Sewu, especially in one of the partially
preserved small temples of the outer file, to the east
of the southern entrance: from a strong stem which
separates into three branches, on three of the sides,
the entrance taking up the fourth, three lotus-flowers
spring from the soil to carry, in a finely
chiselled niche, the (vanished) image of the expected
one, the gone-before and coming-after. A few of
the outlying buildings have plain facings without
any ornament at all, from which it has been concluded
that here too something happened to stop
the labour in progress. Where completed, the
plump-bellied flowerpot, a familiar feature in
Javanese ornament, enters largely into the decorative
design and its frequent repetition bestows on
the sculpture of the <i>chandi</i> Sewu, otherwise so very
similar to that of Prambanan, a character all its
own.</p>

<p>It has already been remarked that the interiors
of the structures which together form this group,
are almost bare of decoration. The recesses of the
central temple, whose external ornament surpasses
in luxuriance everything met elsewhere in Java,
three small interconnected apartments projecting on
the west, north and south, while the eastern front is
broken by the porch, have only empty niches<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
framed by pilasters with flowery capitals. The
inner chamber, no less soberly decorated and
stripped of the statuary it possessed, <i>en négligé</i>
as it were,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>has on its western side a raised throne of ample
dimensions, once perhaps occupied by the large
image without head and right hand, dug out of
the debris and carried off to the “museum” at Jogja.
It still awaits identification and the difficulty is
increased by the impropriety of speculating on the
likelihood that representations of the universal
spirit were admitted in a temple built for the ritual
of a creed which acknowledges neither a god nor a
soul aspiring to communion with the divine essence
in prayer, desiring nothing but annihilation. Yet
the Buddhists did learn to pray and to give transcendental
ideas a tangible expression in human
shape, though they never sank to idolatry. And in
Java, mixing freely with Brahmanism, not imperme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>able
to the Sankhya doctrine, Buddhism seems to
have swerved occasionally from its longings for
extermination in the Nirvana to entertain vague,
confused notions of something more hopeful, witness
the oft repeated Banaspatis. Herein lies, perhaps,
the explanation of otherwise embarrassing peculiarities
observed in the conception, the attributes and
attitudes of many Buddhist statues in the island
which, for the rest, are distinguished by great
simplicity of execution. So is the throne which
extends over half the floor of the inner room of the
central temple of the <i>chandi</i> Sewu, and the same
applies to the few headless Dhyani Buddhas lying
round, sundered from their stations where they
faced the cardinal points, the four quarters of the
world, and the first of them, the very elevated,
facing the sky. A gigantic finger of bronze,
found in the chapel of the throne, supports the
theory that the principal statue was of that alloy,
an additional incentive to plunder&mdash;ancient images
of bronze have become scarce indeed: the form of
the cushioned pedestal in the <i>chandi</i> Kalasan too
betokens a captured metallic Tara, to the further
detriment of the domiciliary rights there claimed
for the homeless Lady of Mystery in the residency
grounds at Jogja.</p>

<p>Although the bulky <i>raksasas</i> which keep her
company in that place of exile, prove that official
vandalism did not hesitate to avail itself of facilities
of transportation afforded by forced labour, the
uncommonly heavy guardians of the <i>chandi</i> Sewu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
balked even the absolute decrees of local despotism.
Everything desirable that could be detached and
removed, is, however, gone. Those in authority
having exercised their privilege by helping themselves,
mere private individuals gleaned after their
reaping, with or without permission, and exceedingly
interesting collections of antiquities were formed
by owners of neighbouring sugar-mills. What they
appropriated, did, at least, remain in the country,
but, among other sculpture, the lion-fighting
elephants which lined the fourteen staircases, ten
feet high and eight feet wide, still in place as late
as 1841, cannot even be traced&mdash;they are dissolved,
battling animals, staircases and all. It is always and
everywhere the same story: statuary and ornament
are stolen, treasure-seekers smash the rest, the
stones are prime building material and who cares
for the preservation of worthless, because already
looted and demolished, tumble-down temples?
The monuments in the plain of Soro Gedoog have
suffered exceptional outrages; at this moment hardly
anything is left because there exists absolutely no
control, says Major van Erp. His investigations
disclosed that stones taken from the <i>chandi</i>
Prambanan and, when this was stopped, from the
<i>chandi</i> Sewu, were used for the building of a dam
in the river Opak. Had not public opinion made
itself heard, both these temples might have shared
the fate of the <i>chandi</i> Singo, once one of the finest
in that region, whose gracefully decorated walls
excited the admiration of Brumund in 1845, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
substructure with damaged ornament still held out
until 1886, while now the ground-plan cannot even
be guessed at and deep holes, dug to get at the
foundations, are the only indications of the razed
building’s site. To give an idea of the quantity of
material used for the dam in the river Opak, I
transcribe the measurements of its revetments: 35
metres on the left and from 50 to 60 metres on the
right bank; the facings, running up to a height of
6 metres, make it evident beyond doubt where the
stone for that work was quarried. Neither are we
quite sure that such frightful spoliation belongs
wholly to the past. The value of Government
solicitude, so eloquently paraded in circulars and
colonial reports, can be gauged from the fact, stated
by Mr. L. Serrurier, that, during officially sanctioned
excavations among the ruins of the <i>chandis</i> Plahosan
and Sewu, the stones brought to the surface were
simply thrown pell-mell on a heap without their
being marked as to locality and position, quite in
keeping, it should be added, with the prevailing
custom.</p>

<p>This accounts for the sad desolation, more pitiful
since <i>soi-disant</i> archaeologists got their hands in,
shone upon at the <i>chandi</i> Sewu as at the <i>chandis</i>
Plahosan, Sari, Kalasan, Panataran, to restrict
myself to one name from East Java,&mdash;shone upon
by the sun, the egg of the world, whose yolk holds
the germ of creation, Surya, the solar orb personified,

decaying into new birth, whether he scorches the
earth and withers the drooping flowers, or climbs a
dim, hazy sky to attract the vapours that descend
again in precious showers when the clouds collect
and cover the stars, charming from darkness the
lovely dawn and budding day. The meditations he
disposes the mind to are mostly directed to the
future, dreams of coming happiness, and even the
contemplative Buddhist images under the Banaspatis
seem agitated by their knowledge of a promise
excelling the hope of Nirvana, which cannot satisfy
the aspirations of the children of this island, full of
the joy of existence. What will the future bring
to them, the people cradled in tempest, who were
taught forbearance by a creed profoundly imbued
with the inner nature of things, and submission
when misery of war and pestilence came as the
harbingers of bondage to an alien race? Too trustful,
they sacrificed their birthright for a mess of
pottage and after the encroachments of the Company,
past ages crowding on their memory, the
felicity of the <i>jaman buda</i> assumes to their imagination
a tangible shape in the ancient monuments
founded by the rulers of their own flesh and blood,
edifices so widely different from the meretricious
Government opium-dens and Government pawn-shops
in which the predatory instinct of the present
masters manifests itself&mdash;<i>layin dahulu, layin sekarang</i>.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
Resigned to fate, which wills the mutability
of earthly relations, the Javanese philosopher&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
all Javanese are philosophers in their way&mdash;takes
the practical view of the Vedantins, considering that
calamities mean purification to the victor in moral
contest, and looking for a serene morning after a
night of distress. He has more beliefs than one to
draw upon when seeking refuge in his cherished
maxim, his phlegmatic <i>apa boleh buwat</i>,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and doubts
not the possibility of obtaining a Moslim equivalent
for the Buddhist <i>arahat</i>, the perfect state, irrespective
of outward conditions, by the help of a Hindu
deity, Ganesa, who knows what is to happen and,
as Vinayaka, the guide, conquers obstacles hurtful
to his votaries in the course of events preordained
according to their Islāmic doctrine&mdash;syncretism yet
more complex than that of their forefathers of Old
Mataram! Watch well the heart, commanded the
master. As to the watched heart dominating the
senses, the Javanese, rather a mystic than an ascetic,
and predominantly a child of nature, whence he
proceeds and whither he returns in his search of the
divine, prefers enjoyment of the world’s fullness to
mortification of the flesh. He feels much more
closely drawn to Padmapani, the lord of the world
that is, than to any other of the emanations of the
essence of the Universe, be it Diansh Pitar or the
One, the Eternal, who sent Muhammad as a mercy
to all creatures, or the Adi-Buddha, the primitive,
the primordial, the incarnate denial of god and soul
together. Whatever he prays by, the deity involved
is one of overflowing gladness, who presents a flower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
with each hand, like Surya when circling land and
sea and air in three steps; and, notwithstanding
his sorrows, he rests content with his portion for,
though the light of day sets, it will rise again in
glory.</p>

<p>Among the ancient monuments of Insulinde<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> the
<i>chandi</i> Boro Budoor stands <i>facile princeps</i>. Situated
in the Kadu, it is easily reached from Jogjakarta, about
twenty-five miles, or from Magelang, about eighteen
miles distant, by carriage or, still more easily, by
taking the steam-tram which connects those two
provincial capitals and leaving the cars at Moontilan
where an enterprising Chinaman provides vehicles,
at short notice, for the rest of the journey via the
<i>chandi</i> Mendoot on the left bank of the Ello, just
above its confluence with the Progo. No better
approach to the most consummate achievement of
Buddhist architecture in the island or in the whole
world, can be imagined than this one, which leads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
past the smaller but scarcely less nobly conceived
and conscientiously executed temple, a commensurate
introduction to the wonderful, crowning edifice
across the waters, portal to the holiest in gradation
of majestic beauty. The Kadu has been well styled
the garden of Java, as Java the pleasance of the
East, full of natural charms which captivate the
senses, abounding in amenities soothing to body
and soul; but if it had nothing more to offer than
the Boro Budoor and the Mendoot, it would reward
the visitor to those central shrines of Buddhism far
beyond expectation.</p>

<p>Behind the horses, a mental recapitulation of the
characteristics of Hindu and Buddhist architecture
in the golden age of Javanese art will not come
amiss, and there may be some wonder that with
so much veneration for the Bhagavat in friendly
competition with the Jagad Guru, nowhere in the
<i>negri Jawa</i> an imprint is shown of the blessed foot
of promise, with the deliverer’s thirty-first sign,
the wheel of the law on the sole. If, in explanation,
it should be adduced that he never travelled to those
distant shores, what does that matter? Has he
been in Ceylon? And how then about the <i>sripada</i>,
the record left there as in so many other countries,
with the sixty-five hints at good luck? While we
revolve such questions, our carriage rolls on; the
coachman cracks his whip, evidently proud of his
skill in turning sharp corners without reining in;
the runners jump with amazing agility off and on
the foot-board and crack <i>their</i> whips, rush to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
front to encourage the leaders of the team up steep
inclines, fall again to the rear when it goes down
hill in full gallop. The exhilarating motion makes
the blood tingle in the veins. How lovely the
landscape, the valley shining in the brilliant light
reflected from the mountain slopes, ...</p>

<p>Another turn and we dash like a whirlwind past
the <i>kachang</i>-oil<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and <i>boongkil</i><a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> mill of Mendoot;
still another turn and, with a magnificent display of
his dexterity in pulling up, our Jehu brings us to a
sudden standstill before the temple. Opposite is a
mission-school conducted for many years, with
marked success, by Father P. J. Hoevenaars, in his
leisure hours an ardent student of Java’s history
and antiquities, ever ready to apply the vast amount
of learning accumulated in his comprehensive reading
on a solid classical basis, to the clearing up
of disputed points, though his modesty suffered the
honours of discovery to go to the noisy players of
the archaeological big drum. His large stock of
information was and is always at the disposal of
whoever may choose to avail himself of it and,
writing of the <i>chandis</i> Mendoot and Boro Budoor,
I acknowledge gratefully the benefit derived from
my intercourse with this accomplished scholar, lately
transferred to Cheribon.</p>

<p>The exact date of the birth of the <i>chandi</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Mendoot is unknown but there are reasons for
believing that it was built shortly after the <i>chandi</i>
Boro Budoor, at some time between 700 and 850
Saka (778 and 928 of the Christian era), in the
glorious period of Javanese architecture to which
we owe also the Prambanan group, the <i>chandis</i>
Kalasan, Sewu and whatever is of the best in the
island. There are additional reasons for believing
that the splendour loving prince who ordered the
Boro Budoor to be raised and under whose reign
the work on that stupendous monument was begun,
founded the Mendoot too as a mausoleum to
perpetuate his memory, and that his ashes were
deposited in the royal tomb of his own designing
before its completion. If so, he was one of the most
prolific and liberal builders we have cognisance of;
but his memory is nameless and all we know of him
personally, besides the imposing evidence to his
Augustan disposition contained in the superb
structures he left, rests upon two pieces of sculpture
at the entrance to the inner chamber of the
mortuary chapel, if such it be, which represent a
royal couple with a round dozen of children, just as
we find in some old western churches the carved
or painted images of their founders’ families.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> We
are perhaps indebted for the preservation of these
suggestive reliefs to the circumstance of the <i>chandi</i>
Mendoot having been covered, hidden from view
during centuries and to a certain extent protected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
against sacrilegious hands by volcanic sand, earth
and vegetation. Almost forgotten, its slumbers
were, however, not wholly undisturbed for, when
Resident Hartman, his curiosity being excited by
wild tales, began to clear it in 1836, he found that
treasure-seekers, out for plunder, had pierced the
wall above the porch and that by way of consolation
or out of vexation at missing the untold wealth
reported to be buried inside, they had carried off or
smashed the smaller, free standing statuary. The
process of cleaning up rather stimulated than prevented
new outrages: stripped of its covering of
detritus, which had shielded it at least against petty,
casual pilfering, the <i>chandi</i> Mendoot excited by
its helpless beauty the most injurious enthusiasm.
Fortunately, the statues which formed its chief
attraction were too big for the attentions of the
long-fingered gentry whose peculiar methods in
dealing with native art strongly needed but never
experienced repression by the local authorities.</p>

<div class="caption">XXIII. <i>CHANDI</i> MENDOOT BEFORE ITS RESTORATION<br />(Cephas Sr.)</div>
</div>

<p>Speaking of the statuary and comparing it with
Indian models, more particularly a four-armed image,
seated cross-legged on a lotus, the stem of which
is supported by two figures with seven-headed
snake-hoods, Fergusson says: The curious part of
the matter is, that the Mendoot example is so very
much more refined and perfect than that at Karli.
The one seems the feeble effort of an expiring art,
the Javan example is as refined and elegant as
anything in the best age of Indian sculpture. Of
the Mendoot carvings, however, more anon. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
shall first endeavour to give a general idea of this
temple which, according to the same writer, though
small, is of extreme interest for the history of
Javanese architecture. Rouffaer calls it the classic
model of a central shrine with substructure and
churchyard, while observing that the principal
statue of the Boro Budoor, the rest of whose statues
are turned either towards one of the cardinal points
or towards the zenith, faces the east and the Mendoot
opens to the west, the two temples therefore
fronting each other. Closely observed, the
latter proved of double design since it consists of a
stone outer sheath, built round an older structure
of brick, the original form with its panellings,
horizontal and perpendicular projections, having
been scrupulously followed. The neatly fitting
joints, both of the hewn stones and of the bricks
of the interior filling, show a mastery of constructive
detail rarely met with at the present day and
certainly not in Java. To this wonderful technique,
adding solidity to a graceful execution of the ground-plan,
belongs all the credit for the Mendoot holding
out, notwithstanding persistent ill-usage. An
ecstatic thought brightly bodied forth by a daring
imagination and astonishing skill, a charming act
of devotion blossoming from the flower-decked soil
as the lotus of the good law did from the garden
of wisdom and universal love, it must have looked
grandly beautiful in its profuse ornament, which
taught how to be precise without pettiness, how
to attain the utmost finish without sacrificing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
ensemble to trivial elaboration. Yet this gem of
Javanese architecture seemed destined to complete
destruction. Its pitiful decay did not touch the
successors of Resident Hartman. When, in 1895,
after several years’ absence from the island, I came
to renew acquaintance, it had visibly crumbled
away; official interference with “collectors” limited
itself to notices, stuck up on a bambu fence, warning
them of the danger they ran from the roof falling
in. It needed two years more of demolition, the
walls bulging out, the copings tumbling down, before
the correspondence, opened in 1882 anent a desirable
restoration, produced some result; before the
Mendoot, the jewelled clasp of that string of pearls,
the Buddhist <i>chandis</i> pendent on the breast of Java
from the Boro Budoor, her diamond tiara, was
going to be refitted.</p>

<p>And how? It is an unpleasant tale to tell: after
two decades of consideration and reconsideration,
in the fourth year of the preliminary labours of
restoration, the local representative of the Department
of Public Works, put in charge of the job
as a side issue of his already sufficiently exacting
normal duties, aroused suspicions concerning his
competency in the archaeological line. An altercation
with Dr. Brandes, followed by more controversy
<i>de viva voce</i>, in writing and in print, led to compliance
with his request that it might please his
superiors to relieve him from his additional and
subordinate task as reconstructor of ancient monuments.
From that moment, January 2, 1901, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
May 1, 1908, absolutely nothing was done and
the scaffoldings erected all round the building were
suffered to rot away, symbolic of the extravagant
impecuniosity of a Government which never cares
how money is wasted but always postpones needful
and urgent improvements till the Greek Kalends
on the plea of its chronic state of <i>kurang wang</i>.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
When most of the fl. 8600, fl. 7235, fl. 25142 and
fl. 4274, successively wrung from Parliament for excavations
and restoration, had been squandered on
what Dr. Brandes considered to be bungling patchwork,
the expensive, useless scaffoldings, becoming
dangerous to the passers-by in their neglected state,
necessitated the disbursement, in 1906, of fl. 350 for
their removal. On the continuation of the work,
in 1908, by other hands, of course a new one,
also of teak-wood, had to be erected. And, the
restoration once more being under way on the
strength of fl. 6800 grudgingly allotted, Parliament
decided finally that no sufficient cause had been
shown to burden the colonial budget with the sum
which, according to an estimate of 1910, was required
to bring it to an end! The profligately penurious
mandarins of an exchequer exhausted by almost
limitless liberality in the matter of high bounties,
subsidies, allowances, grants for experiments which
never lead to anything of practical value; in the
matter of schemes which cost millions and millions
only to prove their utter worthlessness,&mdash;the penny-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>wise,
pound-foolish heads refused, after an expenditure
of fl. 52401 to little purpose, to disburse
fl. 21700 or even fl. 7000 more for the completion
of the work commenced, this time under guarantee
of success. Arguments advanced to make them
revoke their decision, were met with the statement
that the Government did not intend to deviate from
the line of conduct, adopted after mature deliberation
in regard to the ancient monuments of Java, restricting
its care to preservation of the remains ... a
characteristic sample of Governmental cant in the
face of grossest carelessness and the kind of preservation
inflicted on the <i>chandi</i> Panataran or
wherever its officials felt constrained by public
opinion to act upon make-believe circulars from
Batavia and Buitenzorg before pigeon-holing them.
And so the perplexing inconsistencies of Dutch
East Indian finance, parsimony playing <i>chassez-croisez</i>
with boundless prodigality, are faithfully
mirrored in the tribulations of the <i>chandi</i> Mendoot:
the reauthorised work of restoration was stopped
again, on the usual progress killing plea of <i>kurang
wang</i>, after the adjustment of the first tier above
the cornice, and the temple, bereft of its crowning
roof in dagob style, calculated to fix the basic
conception in the beholder’s mind, has in its
stunted condition been aptly compared to a bird of
gorgeous plumage, all ruffled and with the crest-feathers
pulled out.</p>

<div class="caption">XXIV. <i>CHANDI</i> MENDOOT AFTER ITS RESTORATION<br />(Archaeological Service.)</div>
</div>

<p>The operations were hampered by still other contrarieties.
A tremendous battle was waged apropos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of the question whether or not gaps in the layers
of stones of the front wall above the porch pointed
to the existence of a passage or passages for the
admittance of air and light to the inner chamber;
if so, whether or not those passages inclined at an
angle sufficient to let the sun’s rays illumine the
head of the principal statue in that inner chamber.
To rehearse the heated dispute is not profitable:
as usual, after the <i>chandi</i> had fallen into ruin and
an endless official correspondence had lifted its
ruin into prominence, archaeological faddists of every
description tried to acquire fame with absurd
suggestions and crazy speculations. Leaving their
theories regarding the inclinations of the axes of
probable or possible transmural apertures for what
they are, more instruction is to be derived from the
decorative arrangements. The inherent beauty of
the ornament survived happily the injurious effects of
changing monsoons, of ruthless robbery, of preservation
in the Government sense of the word. When
the sun caresses it, the Friendly Day, under the blue
vault of the all-compassing sky, smiling at this gem
of human art, offered in conjugal obedience by the
earth, which trembles at his touch, it seems a sacrificial
gift of reflowering mortality to heaven. In
art, said Lessing, the privilege of the ancients was to
give no thing either too much or too little, and the
remark of the great critic, as here we can see,
applies to a wider range of classic activity than he
had in mind. Wherever the ancient artist wrought,
in Greece or in Java, we find moreover that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
drew his inspiration directly from nature; that his
handiwork reflects his consciousness of the moving
soul of the world; that the secret of its imperishable
charm lies pre-eminently in his keenness of observation.
To Javanese sculpture in this period may be
applied what Fergusson remarked of Hindu sculpture
some thousand years older in date: It is thoroughly
original, absolutely without a trace of foreign
influence, but quite capable of expressing its ideas
and of telling its story with a distinction that never
was surpassed, at least in India. Some animals,
such as elephants, deer and monkeys, are better
represented there than in any sculptures known in
any part of the world; so, too, are some trees and
the architectural details are cut with an elegance
and precision which are very admirable. Turning
to the Mendoot we notice how the sculptors charged
with its decoration, always truthful and singularly
accurate in the expression of their thoughts and
feelings, portrayed their surroundings in outline and
detail, wrote in bas-reliefs, ornament and statuary
the history, the ethics, the philosophy, the religion
of the people they belonged to and materialised their
splendid dreams for. What conveys a better knowledge
of the Tripitaka, the Buddhist system of rules
for the conduct of life, discipline and metaphysics,
than their imagery, coloured by the very hue of
kindliness and effacement of self in daily intercourse;
what inculcates better the <i>paramitas</i>, the six virtues,
and charity the first of them, than their carved
mementos of the reverence we owe to the life of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
all sentient creatures, our poor relations the animals,
striving on lower planes to obtain ultimate delivery
from sin and pain but no less entitled to benevolence
than man?</p>

<p>As in the decoration of the younger <i>chandis</i> Panataran
and Toompang, fables occupy a prominent
position in that of the <i>chandi</i> Mendoot. Among
the twenty-two scenes spread over the nearly
triangular spaces to the right and left of the staircase
which ascends to the entrance, eleven on each side,
partly lost and wholly damaged, are, for instance,
reliefs illustrative of the popular stories of the
tortoise and the geese, of the brahman, the crab,
the crow and the serpents, etc. Of one of them
only a small fragment is left, representing a turtle
with its head turned upward, gazing at something
in the air, whence Dr. Brandes infers its connection
with the following tale, inserted in the account of
the concerted action of the animals which conspired
to kill the elephant, as rendered in the <i>Tantri</i>, an
old Javanese collection of fables: Once upon a time
there were turtles who took counsel together about
the depredations of a ravenous vulture and their
<i>kabayan</i> (chief of the community) asked:&mdash;What do
you intend to do to escape being eaten by that
bird? Accept my advice and lay him a wager that
you can cross the sea quicker than he; if he laughs
at your conceit, you must crawl into the sea where
the big waves are, except two of you, one who
stays to start on the race when he begins to fly,
and one who swims across the day before and waits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
for him at the other side. What do you think,
turtles? You cannot lose if you manage this well.&mdash;Your
advice is excellent, answered they, and while
the <i>kabayan</i> was still instructing them, the vulture
arrived and demanded a turtle to eat.&mdash;What is
your hurry, spoke the <i>kabayan</i> for them all; I bet
you that any one of us can swim quicker across the
sea than you can fly.&mdash;I take that bet, replied the
vulture, but what shall I have if I win?&mdash;If you
win, you will be at liberty to eat me and my people
and our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren
and so on and so on to the end of time;
but you must pledge your word that if you lose, you
will move from here and seek your food elsewhere.
It is now rather late but to-morrow morning you
can choose any one of my people you please to
match your swift flight with.&mdash;All right, said the
vulture and he went to his nest to sleep, but the
<i>kabayan</i> sent one of his turtle-people across the sea.
The vulture showed himself again a little after dawn,
not to waste time, for he felt pretty hungry and the
sooner he could win the race, the sooner he would
have breakfast. He did not even take the precaution
to select an adversary among the decrepit and
slow, so sure was he of his superiority, and, besides,
all the turtles were so much alike. The <i>kabayan</i>
counted one, two, three, go! and the vulture heard
one of them plunge into the water and he unfolded
his wings and alighted at the other side in an instant,
when, lo! there he saw the beast calmly waiting for
him. The vulture felt ashamed and moved to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
distant country for he did not know that he had
been cheated. And there was only one vulture
but there were many turtles. And the boar told
this event to his friends, exactly as the reverend
Basubarga saw it happen.</p>

<p>Another fable, still more widely distributed and
clinching the same moral, is that of the <i>kanchil</i> (a
small, extremely fleet species of deer) and the snail;
travelling to Europe, it is there best known in its
German form recorded by Jakob and Wilhelm
Grimm. Of its many variants in the Malay
Archipelago we may mention the wager between
a snail and a tiger as to which could most easily
jump a river; the snail, attaching herself to one
of her big competitor’s paws, wins, of course, and
convinces the terror of the woods by means of his
hairs adhering to her body, that she is accustomed
to feed on his kind, two or three per diem, freshly
killed, whereupon the tiger leaves off blustering and
sneaks away.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> The prose version of the <i>Tantri</i>
which, somewhat different from the two metrical
readings known to us, contains the vulture and turtle
incident, dates probably from the last half of the
Mojopahit period and is therefore at least four
centuries younger than the <i>chandi</i> Mendoot, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
its author and the sculptors of the scenes from
popular beast-stories on the temple’s walls, must
have had access to a common stock of ancient fables.
All turned it to best advantage and the decorators
of this splendid edifice seized their opportunity to
let the men and animals they carved in illustration
of their national literature, express what they had
to say in their passionate overflow of the creative
instinct. They gave their narrative a frame in
ornament of dazzling beauty, sweetly harmonious
with the moral of the lessons they taught, stirring
to deepest emotion; they cased thoughts of happiest
purport in shrines embossed and laced with fretwork
more suggestive of ivory than of stone. They
adorned the Mendoot as a bride, to be displayed
before her husband, the Boro Budoor, revelling in
the fanciful idea which makes the <i>saktis</i> of the
Dhyani Buddhas carry budding flowers to honour
incarnate love. The wealth of statuary, while
orthodox Buddhism did not admit the worship of
images either of a saintly founder of temples or of
his saintly followers; the deities with the attributes
of Doorga, Siva and Brahma, who diversify the
ornament of the exterior walls, from which right
distribution of lines and surfaces may be learnt in
rhythmical relation to contour and dimension, are
further indications of the syncretism signalising the
tolerance, the fraternal mingling of different creeds
in the distant age of Mataram’s vigour and artistic
energy.</p>

<p>The religious principles underlying that empire’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
greatness and providing a basis for a firm sense
of duty to guide a temperament of fire, are nobly
embodied in the three gigantic statues placed in the
inner chamber of the Mendoot or, to be quite exact,
round which that <i>chandi</i> was reared, for the entrance
is too small to let them through, especially the
largest of them which, miraculously undamaged
save one missing finger-tip, has slid down from its
pedestal and consequently occupies a lower station
between the subordinate figures than originally
intended. All three are seated and the first in
rank, of one piece with his unembellished throne,
measures fourteen feet; the two to his right and
left, of less grave aspect, wearing richly wrought
necklaces, armlets, wristbands, anklets and tiaras,
measure eight feet each. If the <i>oorna</i><a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> more
excellent than a crown, identifies the master among
them, the position of whose fingers reminds of
Vajrochana, the first Dhyani Buddha, the others
have been taken respectively for a Bodhisatva and
for a devotee who attained by his meritorious life
a high degree of saintliness but whose Brahmanic
adornment flatly contradicts the Buddhist character
of such perfection. This explanation is therefore
considered unsatisfactory and unacceptable by many,
as, for instance, his Majesty Somdetch Phra Paramindr
Chulalongkorn, the late King of Siam, who,
by the way, when visiting the <i>chandis</i> Mendoot
and Boro Budoor in 1896, claimed those masterpieces
of <i>mahayanistic</i> art for his own, the southern church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
to use the incorrect but convenient distinction.
According to this royal interpreter, the idea was to
represent the Buddha in the act of blessing the
Buddhist prince who ordered the Boro Budoor to
be built, here placed at his right with an image of
the deliverer in his <i>makuta</i> and carrying no <i>upawita</i>
but a monk’s robe under the insignia of his dignity;
the third statue, directly opposite, at the Buddha’s
left, without Buddhist accessories but with an <i>upawita</i>
hanging down from its left shoulder, might impersonate
him again in his state before conversion, or
his unconverted father on whom, after death, he
wished to bestow a share in the deliverer’s benediction.
However this may be, there is no doubt of
the Enlightened One’s identity in one of his many
personifications and, leaving the eighty secondary
marks unexplored (three for the nails, three for the
fingers, three for the palms of the hands, three for
the forty evenly set teeth, one for the nose, six for
the piercing eyes, five for the eyebrows, three
for the cheeks, nine for the hair, ten for the lower
members in general,&mdash;without our entering into
further detail!), the thirty-two primary signs are all
present: the protuberance on the top of the skull;
the crisped hair (of a glossy black which the sculptor
could not reproduce) curling towards the right;<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
the ample forehead; the <i>oorna</i>, which sheds a white
light (also unsculpturable) as the sheen of polished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
silver or snow smiled upon by the sun; etc. Though
the colossal statue of the welcome redeemer, like
those of the worshipping kings, does not recommend
itself by faultless modelling, it breathes the spirit
which sustains the <i>arahat</i>, him who becomes worthy;
it radiates the tranquil felicity of annihilation of
existence, sin, sorrow and pain; it promises the
final blowing out of life’s candle, the Nirvana, when
the understanding will be reached of the Adi-Buddha,
the primitive, primordial, immeasurable.
And the lowest of the four degrees of the Nirvana,
it seems to say, is already attainable on earth by
emancipation from the bondage of fleshly desire
and vice, by avoidance of that which taints and
corrupts.... The noonday glare, subdued by the
heavy shadow of the porch, fills the sanctuary with
a golden haze and upon its dimly gleaming wings
a faint music descends, a song of deliverance. The
psalmist’s visions of the covering of iniquity compass
us about and invite to recognition of a common
source of divine inspiration in mankind of whatever
creed. The scent of the <i>melati</i> and <i>champaka</i> flowers,
strewn at the feet and in the lap of the deity&mdash;the
image of him who taught that there is none such,
and revered by professed believers in the Book
which consigns idolaters to hell-fire!&mdash;mingles with
the pungent odour of the droppings of the bats,
fluttering and screeching things in the dark recesses
of the roof, disturbed in their sleep. Truly there
ought to be a limit to syncretism and this last
mentioned mixture of heterogeneous elements soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
affects the visitor in a manner so offensive that
retreat becomes a matter of necessity.</p>

<div class="caption">XXV. INTERIOR OF THE <i>CHANDI</i> MENDOOT<br />(Cephas Sr.)</div>
</div>

<p>As we step outside, our eyes are blinded by the
burning light inundating the valley, the fiery furnace
ablaze at the foot of mountains flaming up to the
sky, a terror of beauty: Think of the fire that
shall consume all creation and early seek your
rescue, said the Buddha. It speaks to us of the
cataclysm which shook Java on her foundation in
the waters and upset the work of man, killing him
in his thousands and burying his temples, the
Mendoot and many, many more, under the ashes of
her volcanoes, some such upheaval as when the
conflict began between the Saviour of the World
and the Great Enemy, to quote from the sacred
scriptures; when the earth was convulsed, the sea
uprose from its bed, the rivers turned back to their
sources, the hill-tops fell crashing to the plains;
when the day at length was darkened and a host of
headless spirits rode upon the tempest. Though
the ground has also been raised by the drift down
the slopes of the Merapi, by the overflowing runnels
discharging their load of mud into the Ello and the
Progo, the magnitude of volcanic devastation can
be gauged from the difference in level between
the base of the <i>chandi</i> and the site of the <i>kampong</i>
higher up, under which the platform extends whereon
its subsidiary buildings stood. Excavations in
the detritus have already resulted in the discovery
of portions of a brick parapet once enclosing the
temple grounds; of vestiges of smaller shrines in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the east corner of the terrace and of a cruciform
brick substructure to the northeast with fragments
of bell-shaped <i>chaityas</i>;<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> of a Banaspati, probably
from the balustrade of the staircase, and detached
stones with and without sculptured ornament, which
revealed the former existence of several miniature
temples surrounding the central one. At the time of
my last visit (which came near terminating my career
in my present earthly frame, through the rotten scaffolding
giving way under my feet when ascending
to the roof), more than half of the space conjecturally
encompassed by the parapet, still awaited exploration,
and since then restoration, within the limits of
the scanty sums allowed, seems to have superseded
excavation. In connection with both, the names
should be mentioned of P. H. van der Ham, who
did wonders with the little means at his disposal, and
C. den Hamer, who showed that the decoration of
the Mendoot too was not completed before the
great catastrophe which devastated Central Java
and stopped architectural pursuits.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Reviewing the history of the ancient monuments
of the island, not one can pass without a repetition
of the sad tale of spoliation. However unpleasant
it be to record in every single instance the culpable
negligence of a Government stiffening general
indifference and almost encouraging downright
robbery, the rapid deterioration of those splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
edifices allows no alternative in the matter of
explanation. When officials and private individuals
of the ruling race set the example, the natives saw
no harm in quarrying building material on their own
account for their own houses, and they had no time
to lose in the rapid process of the razing of their
<i>chandis</i> for the adornment of residency and assistant-residency
gardens, the construction of dams, sugar-mills
and indigo factories. Temple stones have
been found in many villages round the Mendoot
and particularly in Ngrajeg, about two miles
distant on the main road, there is no native dwelling
in the substructure of which they have not been
used.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Though the wealth of the <i>dessa</i> Ngrajeg in
this respect may be explained by its once having
boasted its own <i>chandi</i>, of which nothing remains
but the foundations, there is abundant proof that
the chief quarry of the neighbourhood on this side
of the river was the Mendoot as the Boro Budoor
on the other. From a juridical standpoint, the
natives in possession of such spoil, acquired by
their fathers or grandfathers, have a prescriptive
right on it not disputable in law, averred the
administration at Batavia, and so whatever the
architects in charge of the restoration needed, had
to be bought back and diminished still further the
disposable funds. Leaving the doubtful points of
this legal question and the enforcement in practice
of the theoretical decision for what they are worth to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Kromo or Wongso, ordered to part with his doorstep
or coinings, there is <i>no</i> doubt that it is illegal and
highly censurable to demolish temples, and temples
like the Mendoot at that, to secure building material
for Government dams and bridges. What happened
in Mojokerto with the bricks of Mojopahit and has
been complained of elsewhere, I saw happen in
1885 with Mendoot stones, freely used for abutments,
piers, spandrel fillings, etc., when near by
the spanning of the Progo was in progress. That
bridge has since succumbed like the railway bridge
then in course of construction farther down the
Progo, a warning which, if heeded, might have
prevented, for instance, the chronic misfortunes of
the railway bridge in the Anei gorge, West Coast of
Sumatra.</p>

<p>With Government bridges lacking the strength
to resist the impetuosity of more than ordinarily
boisterous freshets, there may always be a surprise
in store for the pilgrim to the Boro Budoor who has
arrived at the first station, the Mendoot: will he or
will he not find the means to cross? For, in time
of <i>banjir</i>, <i>i.e.</i> when the river is in spate, the primitive
ferry which maintains the communication in lieu of
better, a bambu raft or two frail barges fastened
together, fails as to both comfort and safety, and
after heavy rains large groups of men and women
can often be seen waiting for the turbulent waters
to quiet down a bit. Lord Kitchener visited the
Mendoot in December, 1909, during a bridgeless
spell and conditions generally inauspicious to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
proceeding a mile and a half farther to the Boro
Budoor. Otherwise the being ferried over in
company of gaily dressed people going to or coming
from market with fruit, garden produce and all sorts
of merchandise for sale or bought, has its compensations;
rocked by the eddying stream which glides
swiftly between its steep banks, our dominating
sensation is one of joy in the splendour of unstinted
light, of freedom from the petty torments of everyday
routine,&mdash;and let worry take care of itself! As
we climb the opposite shore, comes the mysteriously
grateful feeling of being enveloped in the soil’s
genial exhalation of warm contentment, the fertile
earth’s response to the passionate embrace of
the sun. Their espousal, their connubial ardour
appears incorporate in the <i>chandi</i> Dapoor,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> a
petrified spark of universal love, a wonder of
structural and decorative skill in a shady grove
some hundred paces to the right of the road.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> And
again the <i>spiritus mundi</i> is symbolically interpreted
in the story of yond temple betrothed and wedded
to the tree. They were very much smitten with
each other, the <i>chandi</i> Pawon and a <i>randu alas</i><a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
living in the hamlet Brajanala. They married and
the pretty comedy of affection turned into tragedy:
as chances very often in the case of a weaker and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
stronger partner in the matrimonial game, the latter
throve and prospered at the expense of the former.
Now of his brothers there were and still are many
exactly like him, but of her sisters there were only
few and none of her peculiar kind of beauty, and
since it seemed a pity that she should waste her
singular comeliness in supporting a husband of no
particular worth for all his bigness and parade of
protecting her, a divorce was resolved upon which
meant his sentence of death. Voices in favour
of reprieve or commutation of the penalty were
disregarded: what did one <i>randu alas</i> more or
less matter compared with the preservation of the
exquisite <i>chandi</i> Pawon, sole surviving representative
of her class? So the tree was cut down and she
escaped happily the fate which overtook the <i>chandis</i>
Perot and Pringapoos. The <i>chandi</i> Pawon was
even wholly restored; its foundations, sapped by a
tangle of roots, relaid; its roof reconstructed.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> In
its graceful proportions a striking illustration of the
truth that a great architect can show the vast
range of his art in a very small building, may it
stand many centuries longer between Mendoot and
Boro Budoor as the typical expression of Javanese
thought in Dravidian style!</p>

<p>We turn a corner and the road winds up a hill.
That hill is the base of the Boro Budoor, the long
desired, suddenly extending his welcome, majestic,
overwhelmingly beautiful. It is a repetition on a
much grander scale, much more magical, of the effect
produced by the <i>chandi</i> Derma bursting upon our
view in its sylvan frame, reality taking the semblance
of a glorious dream. In the waning light of evening
the polygonous pyramid of dark trachyte appears as a
powerful vision of the mystery of existence shining
through a veil of translucent gold. Gray cupolas,
raised on jutting walls and projecting cornices, a
forest of pinnacles pointing to heaven, gilded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the setting sun, reveal perspectives of boundless
immensity, vistas of infinite distance. The brilliancy
of heaven, reflected by this mass of forceful imagery,
this conquering thought worked in solid stone,
receives new lustre from the dome-encircled fundamental
idea so mightily expressed. Nowhere has
art more ably availed herself of the possibilities of
site and more felicitously combined with natural
scenery, created a more harmonious ensemble than
in the amazingly original design and delicate
execution of this puissant temple, this gift of the
Javanese Buddhists to posterity, a source of spiritual
quickening to whoso tries to understand.</p>

<p>The <i>pasangrahan</i>, built for the convenience of
visitors to the Boro Budoor, offers fair accommodation
to the student of oriental architecture and lover
of art in whatever form. Also to a good many who
feel it incumbent on them to be able to say: “I have
taken everything in,” or who have quite other ends
in view than communion with the thought of distant
ages: foreign tourists whose principal care is to
exhibit trunks and travelling-bags covered with
labels of out-of-the-beaten-track hotels while their
brains remain hopelessly empty; junketers of
domestic growth, often in couples whose irregular
relations seek shelter behind the excuse of “doing”
the island, and heartily disinclined to practise the
virtues preached in the reliefs of the shrine of
shrines, particularly down on continence. So even
the Philistines derive advantage, after the notions
of their kind, from the ramshackle fabric of vile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
heathenism, as this magnificent temple has been
called by one of their number, and its visitors’ book
tells a sorry tale of irreclaimable vulgarity; the wit,
laboriously aimed at in many entries, but widely
missed, partakes altogether too much (minus the
element of <i>badinage</i>) of the answer given by a
young naval officer to an old aunt when she asked
him where, in his opinion, the most striking natural
scenery of Java was to be found: At Petit Trouville,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
said he, on Sunday in the dry season.</p>

<p>The <i>pasangrahan’s</i> guests of that ilk are generally
no early risers and their company is therefore not
likely to mar the impression received of the Boro
Budoor at second sight after supper, supplied by
the army pensioner in charge of the place, and
a night’s sound rest. Looking tranquillity itself,
the vast pile charms and soothes the heart, notwithstanding
its enormous size, before the intellect,
scrutinising its outline, begins to marvel at the unaccustomed
form the builder has chosen to proclaim
his idea. Save one or two temples in <i>hinayanistic</i>
Burmah, which present a faint resemblance, nothing
else can be named as producing the same effect,
but then, wrote Fergusson for the land where the
creed was born that inspired its founder, it must be
remembered that not a single structural Buddhist
building now exists within the cave region of Western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
India. Rising light and airy for all its grandeur, it
expresses more strength than a mere massing together
of the ponderous material in huge walls and
buttresses and towers could have done; its quiet
consciousness of power is enhanced by its strange
beauty of contour in perfect harmony with its setting
of living colour. There it lies, clasping together the
sapphire sky and the emerald garden of Java.</p>

<p>The <i>mahayanistic</i> character of the Boro Budoor
is well attested by the Dhyani Buddhas among
its statuary, despite the opinion of Siamese connoisseurs,
and by its further ornamental sculpture,
of which more anon. Meant for a reliquary, it may
or may not be, in the absence of historical proof
pro or contra, one of the 84,000 <i>stupas</i> consecrated
to receive and hold a fractional portion of the
Indian Saviour’s remains after King Asoka had
opened seven of the depositories of his ashes in
the eight towns among which his remains were
originally divided, to make the whole world share
in their blessed possession. Who has not heard
of the transfer, in the ninth year of the reign of
Sirimeghavanna, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 310, of the Dathadathu, the
holy tooth, from Dantapura to Ceylon, where it
became the <i>mascotte</i>, so to speak, the pledge of
undisturbed dominion to the rulers of the island
who should control its guardians. The sacrosanct
yellow piece of dentin, about the length of the little
finger,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> enclosed in nine concentric cases of gold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
inlaid with diamonds, rubies and pearls, is but rarely
shown, far more rarely than even the seamless coat
at Treves, and then under conditions of excessive
adoration. But, notwithstanding all this pomp and
circumstance, who that has visited the Dalada
Malagawa at Kandy and the Boro Budoor in Java,
can fail to prefer the latter, though sacrilegious
robbers have carried off its relic, leaving the desecrated
shrine to decay.</p>

<p>The wordy war waged around the etymology of
the name Boro Budoor, did not solve the mystery
of its origin; all derivations thus far suggested
are mere guess-work and unsatisfactory, whatever
reasons be adduced for Roorda van Eysinga’s
explanation that it means an enclosed space, or
Raffles’ surmise that it is a corruption of Bara (the
great) Buddha, or the late King of Siam’s that it
refers to the (spiritual) army of the Buddha, if not to
the several Buddhas, as alleged by others. One of
the oldest existing monuments in the island, the
foundation of the <i>chandi</i> Boro Budoor has been
attributed by native tradition to Raden Bandoong,
already known from the legends connected with
the <i>chandis</i> Prambanan and Sewu, who, as King
of Pengging, assumed the name of Handayaningrat.
Professor Kern<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> puts the date of the substructure at
about 850, allowing several years for its completion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>&mdash;if
ever it was fully completed, for this temple,
like the <i>chandi</i> Mendoot near by, the <i>chandi</i> Bimo
on the Diëng plateau and so many more, shows
traces of the work having been suspended before
the decoration was quite finished. Sculpture just
commenced or little further advanced than the
bare outlining, found on the walls, especially of
the covered base; divers blocks of stone half
transformed into ornament and statuary, Dhyani
Buddhas and lions, very illustrative of the methods
followed at different stages of the carving, lying
forsaken on the slope and summit of a neighbouring
hillock, disclose an interruption of the labour by
some event of tremendous consequence.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Rather
than accept the theory that the ancient temples of
Java were left intentionally defective from religious
motives, viz. to emphasise the sense of human
imperfection as an incentive to humility and prostration
before the divine, we may believe in the
Merapi, that wicked old giant, having asserted
himself in one of his destructive moods, belching
forth flames and ashes, shaking and burying the
handiwork of Hindu and Buddhist pygmies with
strictest impartiality. Standing on the first of the
highest terraces on the south side, says an article<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
in the <i>Javapost</i> of December 5, 1903, one observes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
a bulging out of the lower terraces, best accounted
for by a violent earthquake in a southerly direction.
When the galleries were cleared in 1814 and 1834,
the volcanic character of the detritus which filled
them (ashes from the Merapi, wrote Roorda van
Eysinga in 1850) and also forms the substratum of
the rubbish still unremoved from the once enclosed
grounds of the <i>chandi</i> Mendoot, furnished strong
evidence in support of an eruption of the nearest
fire-mountain having been the cause of the precipitate
flight, perhaps the death in harness, of the
builders. Of the preservation of their work too,
in so far as finished, for, to speak again with the
writer in the <i>Javapost</i>, the very fact of its having
been embedded has saved much of its artistic
detail; and the reason why some of the sculptured
parts are damaged to a far greater extent than
others adjoining, is probably that they were exposed
earlier and longer. Deterioration and demolition
set in rapidly when wind and weather began to
ravage the wholly unprotected edifice, when unscrupulous
collectors wrought havoc unchecked.</p>

<p>The Boro Budoor was never hidden from view
to the point of blotting out its existence from
memory. I shall have occasion to refer to native
chronicles mentioning it in the eighteenth century.
To speak of its rediscovery by Cornelius is therefore
inaccurate though we owe to that clever
Lieutenant of Engineers, purposely sent to the
Kadu by Raffles, in 1814, the first scientific survey
and description with elucidating drawings. Except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
for the publication, in 1873, of Dr. C. Leemans’
book with an atlas containing illustrations after
drawings by F. C. Wilsen, and the mission of
I. van Kinsbergen to obtain photographic reproductions
of the reliefs, the Dutch Government
left the matchless temple entirely to its fate until
very recently. An official correspondence, kept
trailing indefinitely to invest ministerial promises
regarding the antiquities of Java with a semblance
of sincerity, had the usual negative effect. Whenever
a colonial Excellency declared with unctuous
pomposity that the most conscientious care would
be taken of the Boro Budoor, a monument of
incalculable value considered from the standpoint
of science and art, most brilliant memento of the
island’s historic past, etc., etc., those versed in the
phraseology of Plein and Binnenhof at the Hague
trembled in expectation of bad news of criminal
negligence, theft and mutilation to follow. The
later history of the “brilliant memento” agrees
but too well with the ominous prognostics derived
from such dismal parliamentary fustian. A great
poet sang of things of beauty scarce visible from
extreme loveliness: the readily movable things of
beauty constituting the loveliness of the Boro
Budoor, became invisible <i>sans phrase</i>. We are
told in legendary lore of statues which flew
through the air to take domicile at enormous
distances from their proper homes, or vanished
altogether, dissolving into space: the statues of
the Boro Budoor developed that faculty in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
astonishing degree; if handicapped by great weight
or solid attachment to the main structure, bent on
travelling <i>à tout travers</i>, they sent their heads alone
to seek recreation and instruction in the varying
ways of the world, and their heads did never return,
either because they were amusing themselves too
jollily away from the austerities of the eight-fold
path or because they found themselves unavoidably
detained in durance vile.</p>

<p>The remaining, mostly headless statues are sad
to behold, and the fishy account given of their
defective condition, that, namely, the Buddhists,
beleaguered in the sanctuary by the Muhammadans,
battling <i>pro aris et focis</i>, drove the enemies off
by bombarding them with the Lord of Victory’s
noble features, hewn in stone, smacks of a too
ingenious evasion of the disgraceful facts.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> The
chronicles are silent on such a desperate struggle
in that locality between the conquering hosts of
Islām and the followers of him who pleaded peace,
love and goodwill, whose doctrine and example
alike forbade strife and armed resistance. Not that
there has been no fighting round and even within
the walls of the Boro Budoor among the Javanese
engaged in internecine warfare and during the
insurrection of Dipo Negoro,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> but the story of
the using up of the statuary in the shape of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
missiles, has no leg to stand on. In the Java War
(1825-1830) the Dutch troops erected a temporary
fort near the temple, but it is improbable that
<i>chandi</i> material entered into its construction, not
because the warriors of the Government would
have scrupled to destroy any ancient monument,
but because the Boro Budoor stones are exceedingly
heavy and earthen fortifications amply sufficed
against native bands without artillery. Though
cavalry in particular never enjoyed a high reputation
in respect of their relations to art,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> there does
not seem to be any more substance in the confession
of a <i>ci-devant</i> commander of a squadron of hussars,
cited by Brumund, that his men used to try the
temper of their swords on the ears and noses of
the silent host of Dhyani Buddhas when the rebels
of Sentot and Kiahi Maja were not available.</p>

<p>The true misfortune of the Boro Budoor was
official indifference and negligence; and far more
injurious than the fretting tooth of time or even
the merciless hand of the spoiler combined with
the provoking <i>laissez aller</i> yawned in periodical
circulars from the central administration, from
Sleepy Hollow at Batavia, was the dabbling in
archaeology of ambitious persons who posed as discoverers,
the less their aptitude to digest their
desultory reading, the more arrogant their cock-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>sureness
where famous scholars reserved <i>their</i> conclusions.
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing
and might have proved disastrous to the venerable
temple in combination with one of their vaunted
discoveries, which established beyond doubt what
not a few knew well enough and never had doubted
of, viz. that there was a gallery lower than its lowest
uncovered terrace, wisely filled up to increase the
stability of the building, very probably soon after or
even before the erection of the upper storeys. The
removal of the supporting layers of stone impaired,
of course, the general condition of the structure and
the good news of its being again in its former state,
was received by many with a sigh of relief. This
happened in 1885 with great flourish of trumpets, and
the only benefit derived, certainly not of sufficient
importance to balance the inevitable weakening of
the foundations attendant on such excavations, consisted
in the bringing to light of rude, scarcely
decipherable inscriptions or rather scratchings,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> and
the intelligence that of the photographed sculptures,
in which, so far, no representation of connected
events has been recognised, twenty-four are unfinished
and thirteen damaged&mdash;six wholly smashed.
In 1900 new shafts were sunk for new discoveries of
the long and widely known, and while this pernicious
dilettantism was going on, pseudo-archaeologists
vying with professed iconoclasts who should do
most harm to the Boro Budoor, the Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
confined itself to antiquarian pyrotechnics at the
yearly debates on the colonial budget in Parliament.</p>

</div>

<p>The Boro Budoor being undermined and
gradually scattered to the four winds, it was but
natural that the natives, following the example set
by the elect, even by the elect of the elect acting in
this or that official capacity, who used, for instance,
<i>chandi</i> stones for the flooring of the Government
<i>pasangrahan</i>,&mdash;that the inhabitants of the neighbouring
<i>kampongs</i> should carry off what appeared suitable
for their own ends, and the least heavy <i>jataka</i>
reliefs claimed their first attention. So things
went from bad to worse and the most disastrous
year, a veritable <i>annus calamitatis</i> for the Boro
Budoor, arrived with 1896, when the late King of
Siam paid his second visit to Java. Much interested,
as was to be expected of a ruler of a Buddhist
country, in the Buddhist monuments of the island,
so interested, in fact, that his Majesty tried to put
the <i>mahayanistic</i> temples of the Kadu to the credit
of his own, the <i>hinayanistic</i> church, his endeavours
in this kind of mental annexation inspired authorities,
eager to share in the honours of Siamese Knighthood
(White Elephant, Crown of Siam, etc.) distributed
with right royal generosity, to urge him to
annexation in deed. If foreign visitors of little
account had been permitted to help themselves in
a small way to “souvenirs” for a consideration to
keepers’ underlings left without control, why should
foreign visitors of distinction not be served wholesale?
His Majesty Chulalongkorn, to whom no blame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
attaches for gratifying his desire where he found
Dutch functionaries, high and low, more than willing
to oblige, was invited to make his choice and
we must still thank him for his moderation, which
limited the quantity of sculpture selected to eight
cart-loads: there is scarcely a doubt that if he had
requested them to pull part of the Boro Budoor
down in consideration of Knight Commander- or
Grand Masterships in this or that Order, the
official conscience would have raised no objection.
This came to pass, of course, after a more than
usually fine flow, at the Hague, of ministerial
rhetoric anent the priceless heritage Holland has to
protect in the “brilliant mementos of Java’s historic
past,” and the lover of ancient Buddhist architecture
who wants to make a study of its acknowledged
masterpiece, must now of necessity travel on to the
banks of the Meynam to get an idea of some of its
most characteristic imagery, not to speak of fragments
of ornament and statuary removed by tourists
of commoner complexion and dispersed heaven
knows where.</p>

<p>This instance of the ancient monuments of Java
being officially despoiled to please crowned heads and
other visitors in exalted stations, <i>pour le bon motif</i>,
seemed so incredible that, when I censured it in the
Dutch East Indian Press, the Dutch Press, over-zealous
in hiding colonial enormities, also <i>pour le
bon motif</i>, considered it an easy task to deny,
waxing eloquently indignant at the denunciation
until in regular, normal sequence, always observable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
in the perennial case of Dutch whitewashing versus
colonial boldness of speech, the correctness of the
statement could no longer be assailed, new evidence
accumulating steadily, Mr. J. A. N. Patijn, for one,
describing, in the <i>Kroniek</i> and the <i>Tijdschrift voor
Nederlandsch Indië</i>, a collection displayed near the
Wat Pra Keo at Bangkok and brought thither
from Java in 1896.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The frolicking monkeys doubtless,
the people of the large cheek-bones, represented
on some reliefs thus transferred, prompted
an enthusiastic, genuine archaeologist’s imprecation
on the heads of the guilty official and non-official
toadies, inasmuch as he wished them, if there be
anything in the dogma of Karma, which provides
for our sins being visited on us in lives to come,
that their least punishment might be their transformation,
when called to new birth, into apes
abandoned to ceaseless squabbles over their <i>kanari</i>-nuts
(honours, dignities, preferment with big salaries,
fat pensions, etc.), clawing one another with their
sharp nails, to find at last that all the shells are
empty. Desisting from a profitless discussion on
the possibilities of retribution in a future existence,
it requires to be stated that the official mind needed
several years’ reflection in this before reaching the
conclusion that really, in the matter of the conservation
of the Boro Budoor something more was wanted
than the periodical outbursts of gushing sentiment,
grossly disregarded in practice, which are <i>le moyen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
de parvenir</i> of Dutch colonial politicians. The independents
of the colonial Press, however, had at last
the satisfaction that Captain T. van Erp of the
Engineers was detailed to take the work of restoration
in hand, building himself a house in the shadow
of the <i>chandi</i> confided to his care, anxious to direct
the necessary labours on the spot. Stationed there
since August, 1907, his promotion to the rank of
Major fortunately did not result in the withdrawal of
his services from the archaeological field and, the
climax of laxness with regard to the Boro Budoor
having been capped in the Siamese episode, brighter
days may dawn for that venerable edifice.</p>

<p>One of the rooms of the <i>pasangrahan</i>, reserved,
under the old dispensation, for the storing of
detached pieces of sculpture, was called the sample-room
because, according to current report, orders
were taken there for the delivery of such still
undetached ornament and statuary as might have
struck the visitors’ fancy. Other images lined
the path from the <i>pasangrahan</i> to the temple,
among them two Dhyani Buddhas, a fine Akshobhya
and a still finer Amitabha, and lions,
the poor remainder of those which once adorned
the steps leading to the raised level of the building,
whence the name: Avenue of Lions. Seemingly
commanded to descend from the places where
they kept guard as solitary sentinels, and to unite
for defence at the point of greatest danger, terrible
havoc was wrought in their ranks by the onslaught
of souvenir-hunters, and one of their large-limbed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
beautifully chiselled chiefs, who himself watched
the entrance with a vauntful air as if proclaiming
to foe and friend alike: <i>Et s’il n’en reste qu’un, moi
je serai celui-là</i>, had to suffer the ignominy of being
captured and carried off to Siam&mdash;which proves
his Majesty Chulalongkorn’s good taste: it was
the best specimen of animal carving on that scale
in Java. These are no cheerful reflections when
approaching the eminence skillfully converted into
a <i>stupa</i> whose equal, both in originality of
design and cleverness of execution, can nowhere
be found. Though India furnished its prototype,
the style here evolved baffles, on close examination,
all comparison. The only building it can
be likened to is the Taj Mahal at Agra, and only
in this single respect while differing in all others,
that, conceived by a titanic intellect, the delicate
decoration suggests the minute precision of the
jeweller’s craft. Opening and closing a distinct
chapter in architecture, this admirable production
rises in terraces which form galleries round the
hill-top, enclosed by walls, spaced on the outside
by 432 niches for statues of the Buddha with
<i>prabha</i> (aureole) and <i>padmasana</i> (lotus cushion),
on the inside with representations illustrating sacred
and profane writings in bas-relief; the galleries
of the superstructure raised on the square ground-plan,
become circular and are bounded by 72 bell-shaped
<i>chaityas</i> containing statues of the Buddha
without either <i>prabha</i> or <i>padmasana</i>, or any ornament
whatever. The profuse decoration of their surround<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>ings
never detracts from the powerfully expressed
central idea of praise to the Enlightened One,
the one who has fulfilled his end; the repetition
of the motives manifesting the religious purpose,
directs rather than confuses the attention of the
worshipper in their multiformity of application.
The spiritual father of the Boro Budoor must
have been a man of strong mental grasp, of honest
masculine endeavour stimulated by a highly sensitive
temperament; his work, “a goodly heap for
to behold,” growing in dignity and beauty the
closer it is observed, a realisation of the sublimest
aspirations of Buddhist Java, will perpetuate also,
as long as it can endure, the memory of his own
superior mind.</p>

<p>The constructive ability of this gifted builder
was no less wonderful than his mastery of detail
in aid of his main intent. A clever system of
drainage attests to the foresight of his workmanship;
but the gutters remaining filled up and the
gargoyles (open-mouthed <i>nagas</i>) choked after the
excavation of the galleries in 1814 and 1834,
without any one thinking of clearing them too,
the water had to flow off as best it could in the
torrential rains of successive west monsoons, filtering
through the fissures between the stones, passing
down to the foundations and adding, in oozing
out, to the causes of decay by washing the supporting
layers of earth and gravel away. The
staircases and passageways to the different terraces
and galleries are constructed with the accurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
sense of right proportion which distinguishes the
natives of the island up to this day, and their <i>naga</i>- and
<i>kala-makara</i> ornament belongs to the most
impressive part of the graceful decoration. In our
ascent from lower to higher planes of understanding,
increasing in perception of the mysteries of life
and death, the Banaspati shows the road, the
Hindu-Javanese Gorgon’s head as Horsfield called
it, appropriated by Buddhist architecture, figurating
the terrors of error it faces while budding forth
in the promise of further guidance for whoso shall
leave the world’s delusions, a loved wife, a young-born
son, to seek the truth in pursuance of the
Buddha’s ordinance: no intimidation which threatens
with the pains of hell all who dare to disobey
the dictates of priestly ambition, but an assurance
of beatitude gained by self-purification. The staircases
of the superstructure correspond with the
four approaches leading up the hillock to the
temple-yard; in the course of the excavations,
undertaken to facilitate the work of restoration,
one of them, very much out of repair, has been
laid bare. The reconstruction of the lower principal
staircase, whose original position has now been
determined, will result, it is hoped, in the removal
of the unsightly flight of uneven steps masquerading
as the main entrance at the corner opposite the
<i>pasangrahan</i>; and, perhaps, to provide one worthy
of site and building, the Government will not
haggle over the modest sum required for the
re-erection of the monumental gate whose remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
were discovered adjoining the balustrade of the
spacious elevated platform.</p>

<p>On entering the galleries, establishing contact
with this symmetrical embodiment of highly spiritualised
thought in the strongly knit language of
chiselled stone, to mount to the state of the perfect
disciple, spurred by the figured evolution of the
four degrees of Dhyana which lead to supreme
happiness, the pilgrim must have experienced, as
we do, the sensation of physical well-being imparted
by the splendour of nature wrapping human longings
in sunshine and the delicious odour exhaled by
mother earth. The luxurious emotion increases,
despite nirvanic chastening, and among the serene
images of the higher terraces, who can remain unmoved
in contemplation of the ancient temple lifting
its dagob to the blue heaven, of its hoary walls
touched by the golden light, quivering in desire
of sacred communion! Nor do we cease to marvel
when turning from the general idea of universal
solidarity, enunciated in an irreproachable architectural
form, to the expository details of decoration.
The ornament accommodates itself with amazing
facility to the characteristic tendencies of the
ground-plan, never perverting the central purpose,
which dominates in a most felicitous combination
of the two principles separately developed for
western ends in the classic and gothic styles: the
horizontal expansion to allow thinking space to
the brain and the mystic pointing upward to satisfy
the cravings of the heart. Both found application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
in the Boro Budoor, their unity of thought in
diversity of expression being consolidated by an
inexhaustible wealth of imagery, elucidating accessories,
filled as it is “with sculptures rarest,
of forms most beautiful and strange.” Faithful
in choice of subject and manner of representation
to the notions of its time, bodying forth things
unknown to our age, the ornament surprises by
its fanciful invention and peculiar treatment, though
always in the best of taste. The heavy cornice
which protects the lowest uncovered tier of external,
so far not yet satisfactorily explained reliefs, carries
the niches for the statues already mentioned. The
shape of these niches and of the temples delineated
in the scenery of the carved tales and legends,
here as at Prambanan, Toompang, etc., afford
us material assistance in determining after what
model <i>chandis</i>, long fallen into ruin, were built;
they are especially helpful in explaining the often
puzzling arrangement of the superstructures, hardly
one being found, even among those best preserved,
with the roof still intact. Leaving archaeological
problems alone, modern architects and decorators
can further derive a good deal of profit from a
study of the gradation observed in the downward
radiation of both the architectural and decorative
conceit centred in the crowning dagob, or, rather,
the upward convergence in a nobly devised distribution
of spaces connected and entwined by
cunning ornament, the luxuriant fantasy of the
sculptor being unerringly controlled by the staid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
design of the builder. A fervent imagination may
revel in miles of bas-reliefs without surfeit, the
salutary restraint of a sober outline and a proportional
disposition of the component parts being
such that the eye never gets tired or the faculty
of perception cloyed.</p>

<p>Fergusson, pointing to the identity of workmen
and workmanship in the sculpture and details of
ornamentation at the Boro Budoor and at Ajunta
(cave 26), Nassick (cave 17), the later caves at
Salsette, Kondoty, Montpezir and other places in
that neighbourhood, computes that at the former
the decoration extends to nearly 5000 feet, almost
an English mile, and, as there are sculptures on
both faces, we have nearly 10,000 lineal feet of
reliefs. They numbered 2141 in all, counting what
is damaged and altogether lost, but omitting the
decoration of the ornamental niches: on the lowest
wall 408 in the upper and 160 in the lower tier
outside, 568 inside; on the second wall, 240 outside
and 192 inside; on the third wall, 108 outside and
165 inside; on the fourth wall, 88 outside and 140
inside; on the fifth wall, 72 inside. Regarding
their noble qualities of style and decorative value as
a component of the general project, the opinion of
a writer in the <i>Quarterly Review</i><a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> may be quoted,
who discusses the Boro Budoor’s straight lines, its
untroubled spaces of flat stone, its mouldings of
classic simplicity, its intricate and elaborate bands
of ornament, held in place by the nice choice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
relief, being low and unaccented, in opposition
to the deep cutting and full modelling of the panels
they surround; and in these panels, he continues, in
spite of the full roundness of the modelling and the
wealth of ornamental detail, the unity is maintained
by a fine sense of rhythm and discreet massing and
spacing. The upper tier of carvings on the inner
wall of the first gallery, haut-reliefs in contradistinction
to the rest, represents the life of the Buddha
from his birth until his death and is the best preserved.
Many of the others have suffered so
badly that they baffle explanation; taken on the
whole, they treat of traditional occurrences in connection
with the Buddha himself or his predecessors,
of gatherings under bo-trees, pilgrimages
to reliquaries, alms-giving, exhortations to observe
the law, admonitions to virtue: abstinence, tolerance
and charity. Animal fables are interwoven with
<i>jataka</i>-tales, <i>i.e.</i> narratives concerning the Buddha
before he appeared as the perfect man, tracing his
path to holiness in his adventures as a hare, a fish,
a quail, a swan, a deer, the king of monkeys, an
elephant, a bull, a wood-pecker, a tortoise, the horse
Balaha, every metamorphosis serving to illustrate his
zeal to sacrifice himself for his fellow-creatures and,
incidentally, stimulating the kindness we owe to our
poor relations without the power of speech. Professor
Speyer’s translation of legends collected in the
<i>Jatakamala</i> (wreath of <i>jatakas</i>) enables us to recognise
in a good many of the reliefs of the Boro Budoor
the successive stages of the Buddha on the road to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
supreme excellence, the figuration of his progress
being largely influenced by ancient Hindu folk-lore.</p>

<p>If Ruskin compared St. Mark’s at Venice so
aptly with a vast illuminated missal, bound with
alabaster instead of parchment, studded with porphyry
pillars instead of jewels, and written within
and without in letters of enamel and gold, in the
Boro Budoor, a sacred book of volcanic stone, the
life of the Buddha, before and after he became a son
of man and man’s saviour, lies opened before us: the
flowery earth and the shining heaven are its binding;
Surya, the sun himself, gilds and enamels the letters,
the images which, in their sculptured frame, not too
deeply cut and not too rich for a setting, but
precisely adequate, tell to all creatures the story
of wisdom and elevation of spirit. The illustration
of the <i>Lalita Vistara</i> occupies, as already mentioned,
the upper tier of the inner wall of the first open
gallery. Walking round in the proper direction, <i>i.e.</i>
keeping the dagob to the right while moving with
the sun, we have first a few introductory scenes,
leading up to the Buddha’s advent and preparing
us for the mystic teachings of an imagery which
expands simply and naturally between the flowing
lines of harmonious ornament and speaks to the heart
as does the sound of running water or the soughing
of the wind in the tree-tops. Immediately after his
birth, rising from the white lotus-flower which has
sprung from the earth at the place touched by his
feet, Siddhartha, in token of his power over the
several worlds, paces seven steps to each of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
cardinal points and to the abode of sin, announcing
his mission: I shall conquer the Prince of Darkness
and the army of the Prince of Darkness; to save
those plunged into hell, I shall cause rain to descend
from the huge cloud of the law and they will be
filled with joy and happiness. He grows and
marries and leaves his father’s palace, moved by the
misery of the lowly and lost, to gather knowledge
as Sakyamuni, until, compassing all wisdom, he
becomes impersonated truth and the great renunciation
takes place. The closing scene refers to his
death, to the adoration of the mortal remains of the
immortal Tathagata, symbolising his course among
men not as a succession of past acts but as a
constant one to be imitated by whoso desires the
reward. Increasing in excellence of design and
execution the nearer we approach the Holy of
Holies, the touching tale of a life of sacrifice is told
with that straightforward simplicity of which only
the consummate artist possesses the secret. All
appears so human and real, so inspiringly animated
by the extreme of vital motion, to use an oriental
expression, the individuality of the figures being
always preserved in minutest personal detail without
the least affectation. Plastic triumphs, emphasising
the lessons of the sacred books, bring up unto us
the people of <i>jaman buda</i>, heroes tall and strong
as palm-trees, virgins lithe and slender as bambu-stems,
with drooping eyes, shrinking from a too
inquisitive gaze, with limbs modelled as if they would
tremble under the pressure of a caressing hand.</p>

<p>The statues, watching the ascent of the seeker of
purification, second the impulse received from the
reliefs by their tranquil composure, that is in so far
as they remained at their stations, for their ranks
are sadly thinned. Aspiring to the holiness figured
in the images of the higher terraces, to the priceless
boon of the Nirvana as final blessing, the Dhyani
Buddhas, sunk in meditation, girding themselves
with virtue, longing for the ecstasies vouchsafed to
the Adi-Buddha’s meditation, reflect the five salient
features of his understanding, as indicated by their
gestures. Divided into three or twice three groups,
according to the position of their hands, and in
intimate relationship with their Bodhisatvas, Vajrochana,
Akshobhya and Ratnasambhava are
supposed to have swayed, during thousands of
years, the three worlds which successively disappeared,
as Amitabha, whose Bodhisatva is
Padmapani, sways since twenty-four centuries the
present world, in closest spiritual union with the historical
Buddha, to be succeeded by Amoghasiddha,
whose Bodhisatva is Vishvapani, the ultimate
Buddha, the Buddha of universal love. Facing the
four cardinal points and the zenith, they sit with
crossed legs,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> clothed in a thin robe which leaves
the right shoulder and arm bare, and have the distinctive
protuberance of the skull, generally also the
<i>oorna</i>, the symbol of light, be it then produced by the
sun or by lightning. A sixth Buddha, represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
by the statues of the fifth and highest wall, is
supposed to refer to a power which dominates the
other five, swaying in last resort the destinies of all
worlds without exception; but this theory still
needs confirmation. The statues of the circular
terraces stood, or rather sat, in bell-shaped <i>chaityas</i>,
four to five feet high, capped with tapering key-stones
which carry conical pinnacles&mdash;no <i>lingas</i>,
though this oft recurring motive of Hindu
decoration may have suggested the idea. These
<i>chaityas</i>, 72 in number<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> and for the greater part in
ruin, shattered shells of sanctity, were closed all
round and the images inside, without aureoles, like
the Buddhas lower down, only visible through
openings in the form of lozenges. Their peculiar
contour has led to the conjecture that they were
constructed after the holy <i>padma</i> or lotus-flower, a
hypothesis to which their <i>padmasana</i>-like bases and
the numerous peepholes, which might figurate
empty seed-lobes, lend some colour. Of the 72
Buddhas they protected, eighteen are wholly lost
and no more than ten escaped grievous hurt.</p>

<p>Winding our way upward, passing through the
galleries whose profound silence, imbued with the
intensely religious spirit radiating from their sculptured
walls, becomes more and more eloquent;
circling the terraces where the attitude of ecstatic
elation of the world’s pre-eminently venerable ones
in their <i>chaityas</i> exalts the mind in tremulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
expectation, we arrive at the dagob, the shrine of
shrines, the temple’s coronet, glittering in the bright
glow of day. This is the reliquary proper, the
centre into which the holiness of the hallowed
building converges. It rises, similar to the smaller
cupolas, but perpendicular to a height of several
feet, from a substructure in the guise of a lotus
cushion; it was also closed round about, without
any aperture so far as can be concluded from its
present state, for a portion of it has tumbled down
and the base of the crowning pinnacle, reached by
ill-matched, rickety steps, a recent, outrageously
discordant addition, serves for a bench, the whole,
about 25 feet above the topmost terrace, having
been transformed into a crude belvedere, enabling
visitors to enjoy the magnificent view. The interior
space seems originally to have been divided into an
upper and a lower chamber; there is nothing
deserving mention in the matter of decoration save
an inscription to remind posterity of the late King
of Siam’s visit in the disastrous year 1896&mdash;a
delicious memorial, at the same time, of official
vandalism and servility. The golden letters affect
one unpleasantly in the spoliated sanctum, whose
ruinous condition dates from a previous call, some
sixty or seventy years ago, permitted if not encouraged
by previous authorities, when looting
pseudo-archaeologists broke into it and carried off
the relic, which consisted, assuming the credibility
of local reports regarding their disappointment, in a
small quantity of ashy substance, enclosed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
metal urn with lid; furthermore in a small image of
metal and a few coins. The large statue they unearthed
too, would have impeded the movements of
the marauders on their return voyage and so it
remained in place, half hidden in the hole they had
dug, undisturbed, for the same reason, by subsequent
collectors. Left unfinished by its sculptor,
designedly or not,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> resembling in the position of its
hands the Dhyani Buddhas which face the East,
does it personify the Adi-Buddha, a purely abstract
entity, a metaphysical conception hitherto defying
even symbolic utterance? The learned and especially
the quasi-learned never lacked weighty arguments
pro or contra, and, without prejudice to all they
proved and disproved,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> it does not appear improbable
that the lively imagination of the Javanese
artist aimed at a tangible expression of him who
ran his course as the spirit and source of the
Buddhist conception of happiness, resuscitated from
his ashes, dominating East and West, North and
South, the blissful abode of those progressing in self-negation
and the infernal regions of prolonged
earthly existence, by the strength of the divine
rays proceeding from the <i>oorna</i>, illumining the
path trodden by the virtuous toward annihilation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
terrifying the children of darkness, dwellers in
passion and sin, pervading all creation with his
saintliness, the one of the Paranirvana whose
essence flowers in the beauty of the Boro Budoor.
And the Moslim native worships him as the god of
his ancestors, caught in stone; smears him with
<i>boreh</i> and performs acts of sacrifice before him in
spite of the Book fulminating against idolaters and
of the almost contemptuous familiarity intimated by
the otherwise very appropriate nickname bestowed on
this heterodox deity, namely <i>recho belèq</i>, which
means “statue in the mud”.</p>

<div class="caption">XXXV. RELIEFS OF THE BORO BUDOOR<br />(C. Nieuwenhuis.)</div>
</div>

<p>The work of restoration, started with excavations
and the removal of heaps of accumulated debris, has
led to important discoveries, also in relation to the
dagob. Among shattered <i>naga</i>-gargoyles, antefixes,
carved detail of every description, fragments have
been found of a triple <i>payoong</i>, an ornament in the
form of a sunshade which capped it; of a statuette
supposed to have adorned its second storey, the
upper compartment of the cella. To quote from
Major van Erp’s last published report,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> the excavations
shed new light on the design of some minor
parts of the building, the decoration, <i>e.g.</i>, of the
lowest three staircases on each of the four sides;
notwithstanding the existing drawings, the <i>kala-makara</i>
motive seems to have entered into the
ornament of the entrance gate in the principal outer
wall; the design of the balustrade which enclosed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the platform of the temple and disappeared altogether,
has been determined and a portion of it will be
rebuilt to show how things must have looked; slabs
belonging to the different series of bas-reliefs,
mostly of the <i>jataka</i> variety, have been unearthed
or detected in neighbouring <i>kampongs</i>. Especial
care is taken to retrieve those missing from the
upper tier in the first gallery: if the recovered
reliefs are not always complete, the recognisable
principal figure explains generally the idea which
the sculptor intended to convey, with sufficient
clearness to be grasped by the trained archaeologist.
And as to the rest of the detached pieces of
architectural value, dug up or otherwise revealed to
the searching eye, the symmetric unity of the Boro
Budoor is such that place and position of each
component part, however subordinate in the
mighty fabric, are easily ascertained. Every new
find discloses new excellence, so far undreamt of,
in the constructive ability of the master-builder
whose illuminated brain conceived the idea of this
temple wherein he wrote the history of a religion,</p>

<p>His name is unknown, though native fancy,
descrying his likeness in the profile of the Minoreh
mountains, a fine conceit worthy of his genius, has
baptised him Kiahi Guna Darma. Another tradition
calls him Kiahi Oondagi and makes him chisel
the statue which, up to the time of the late King of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Siam’s visit in 1896, stood near the <i>pasangrahan</i>,
facing a damaged Amitabha and seemingly heartening
the diminishing ranks of the lions mounting
guard. It had been brought thither from a place
known as Topog, about a mile distant, and was
certainly a portrait-statue, beautifully cut and with
its extraordinarily clever features a rare work of art.
The story goes that, like Busketus, the architect
(with Rainaldus) of the Duomo at Pisa, his dearest
wish was to have his remains carried to rest under
the stones of the edifice he had raised to the honour
of the unseen; that, baffled in his hopes and reincarnated
after his death because of some venial
offence which made him fail in attaining the
Nirvana too, he fashioned this effigy to be set up at
the entrance of his <i>magnum opus</i>, anticipating an
idea of the equally nameless artist who put the
Byzantine stamp on San Marco in Venice. It is an
additional proof of the late King Chulalongkorn’s
discrimination in favour of the very best that,
making the permitted choice, his Majesty included
Kiahi Oondagi, but O! the official cringing and the
little piety shown to the memory of the illustrious
labourer who wrought this wonderful monument.</p>

<div class="caption">XXXVII. REACHING THE CIRCULAR TERRACES OF THE BORO BUDOOR<br />(Cephas Sr.)</div>
</div>

<p>On the hillock of Topog, the <i>deva agoong’s</i> primitive
home, two wash-basins in the form of <i>yonis</i>, one
of them of colossal dimensions and resting on a
crouched figure, testify to the worship of Siva’s
<i>sakti</i>, the female principle of life personified in the
Mahadeva’s Devi. Hindu motives in the ornament
of the Boro Budoor avouch syncretism having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
influenced the highest expression of Buddhism
itself: there is a four-armed image with <i>padmasana</i>
and <i>prabha</i>, which, carrying a Buddha in its <i>makuta</i>,
may hint at Vishnu’s ninth <i>avatar</i>; there is a four-armed
figure seated on a throne supported by Siva’s
<i>vahana</i>, the bull; there is a goddess crowned with
five <i>trishulas</i>; etc. All this illustrates again native
tolerance in matters of religion as in other respects,
a result of the ancient habit of the Javanese in
particular, to meet widely different races and civilisations
half-way, which has preserved them from
the narrow-mindedness consequent on isolation, as
observed by a scholar who knows them well and
whose study of special subjects has in nowise impaired
his breadth of vision.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> The modification of
this easy-going temperament in contact with western
greed, offers abundant food for thought when we
return to the cool cave of refuge from passion where
the <i>recho belèq</i> symbolises deep contemplation and
meditation terminating in absorption of self by
participation of the Spirit of the Universe, under the
gaudy memorial tablet, <i>Koning van Siam: 1896</i>,
which, in its glaring incongruity, symbolises the
inverted process.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The feeling of annoyance it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
produces, soon passes when the mind begins to
expand with admiration of the scene of calm splendour
beheld from the dagob containing the pollen
of the lotus of the law. The hues and harmonies
of evening dispose to a quietude nowhere else
experienced or enjoyed in that measure. The only
sound heard is a faint humming of insects circling
the pinnacles of the <i>chaityas</i> which divide the
panorama of the plain below into views of separate
interest and beauty, bounded by the graceful outline
of the terraces and the distant hills. Ricefields and
palmgroves stretch as far as the eye can reach, with
villages between, sheltered by their orchards, earth’s
tapestry, embroidered in all gradations of green
from that of the sprouting <i>bibit padi</i> of the young
plantations to that of the thick foliage of centenarian
<i>kanaris</i>. The shadow of the temple, kissing the
drowsy eyelids of the Kadu, lengthens towards the
Merapi over whose crater, gilt by the setting sun,
hangs a cloud of dark smoke which drifts slowly in
the direction of the Merbabu, while the Soombing,
to the northeast, looks tranquilly on. The darkness,
ushered by the smoke of the ill-tempered old fire-mountain,
mingling with the pink and purple of the
western sky, spreads over the land, envelops forests
and gardens in gray, hushing all that breathes to
sleep. One parting smile of the sun’s gladness and
night descends in her sable robes. Nothing stirs;
the toils of day are forgotten in wholesome repose;
it is the hour of Amitabha, ruler of the region of
sunset and spiritual father of the present world’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
ruler, the one whose hands rest in his lap after
the completion of a laborious task. Morning will
come and in time the creation of a new world, the
world of loving-kindness, Vishvapani’s, the Metteya
Buddha’s own&mdash;in time, long time! A <i>gardu</i><a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
strikes seven; another answers immediately with
eight strokes on the <i>beloq</i>;<a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> far away no more than
six respond,&mdash;what is time to the native! Silence
reigns again, silence emphasised by the high-pitched
notes of a <i>suling</i>,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> quavering indistinctly as the
evening breeze speeds the lover’s complaint or
refuses its aid. A noise of revelry in the <i>pasangrahan</i>
distracts the attention from this tuneful
courtship; the visionary beings that were taking
life from the germ of thought hidden in its shrine,
petrify into mute statues or vanish altogether: the
spell of the Boro Budoor is broken.</p>

<p>It has already been remarked that the natives
knew of the existence of the <i>chandi</i> Boro Budoor
long before Cornelius’ discoveries or, rather, that
they never lost sight of it, and the place it occupies
in the Javanese chronicles appears from the <i>Babad
Tanah Jawa</i>.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> In the early years of the eighteenth
century Ki Mas Dana, son-in-law of Ki Gedeh
Pasukilan, incited the people of Mataram to a
rebellion, which broke out in the <i>dessa</i> Enta Enta,
a centre of sedition it seems, since only a short
time before a certain Raden Suryakusumo, son
of Pangeran Puger, had chosen the same village
for his headquarters when rising against Mangku<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Rat II., who captured him and put him in an iron
cage without, however, killing him, because the
omens were unfavourable.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Ki Mas Dana had
many followers and appointed <i>bupatis</i> and <i>mantris</i>.
Ki Yagawinata, <i>bupati</i> of Mataram, marched
against him but was defeated and fled to Kartasura,
acquainting his Majesty with what had happened.
Thereupon Pangeran Pringgalaya was sent to suppress
Ki Mas Dana’s revolt, with instructions to
capture him alive because his Majesty had made
a vow that he would exhibit him publicly as an
example to the inhabitants of Kartasura and let
him be <i>rampokked</i><a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> with needles. Pangeran Pringgalaya
departed and with him half of the <i>bupatis</i>
of Kartasura. When he arrived at Enta Enta the
battle began. Many rebels were killed. Ki Mas
Dana fled to the mountain Boro Budoor. He was
surrounded by the troops of Pangeran Pringgalaya
and made a prisoner. Then they brought him to
his Majesty at Kartasura, who ordered all the
inhabitants of the town to assemble in the <i>aloon
aloon</i>, each of them with a needle. It lasted three
days before all the inhabitants of Kartasura had
had their turn. When he was dead, his head was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
cut off and exhibited on a pole. After the execution
of Ki Mas Dana, the news was received that
his father-in-law Ki Gedeh Pasukilan had also
revolted. His Majesty ordered the repression of
that revolt too. Ki Gedeh Pasukilan was defeated
and killed.</p>

<p>Dr. Brandes, observing that the <i>chandi</i> Boro
Budoor must have been meant because there is no
other place known of the same name and its strategical
value, given ancient modes of warfare, is
obvious, puts the date of its investment by Pangeran
Pringgalaya to seize Ki Mas Dana, at 1709 or 1710.
A native reference to the Boro Budoor of half a
century later, is found in a Javanese manuscript,
used by Professor C. Poensen for a paper on
Mangku Bumi, first Sooltan of Jogjakarta.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> The
conduct of the Pangeran Adipati, son of that
Sooltan, grieved his father very much. Besides
his ignorance in literary matters, he was proud
and arrogant; he disdained his father’s advice and
associated with the women of the toll-gate, which
caused all sorts of annoyance. He went also to the
Boro Budoor to see the thousand statues, notwithstanding
an old prediction that misfortune would
befall the prince who beheld those images, for one
of them represented a <i>satrya</i> (a noble knight)
imprisoned in a cage; but it was the Prince’s fate
that he wished to see the statue of the <i>satrya</i>.
Having gratified his desire, he remained in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Kadu, where he led a most dissolute life. This
gave great sorrow to his father, the Sooltan, because
the scandal reached such dimensions that the
(Dutch) Governor at Samarang heard of it and
reprimanded him. Ashamed and angry, he sent a
few <i>bupatis</i> with armed men to order the Pangeran
Adipati to return to Ngajogja (Jogjakarta); if he
refused, they had to use violence and were even
authorised to kill him. The Pangeran Adipati
obeyed and was kindly received by his father,
but soon after he fell ill, spat blood and died. A
letter of the Governor-General J. Mossel, dated
December 30, 1758,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> contains the passage: “His
Highness’ eldest son, the pangerang Adipatty
Hamancoenagara, having departed this life, ...”
and the profligate Crown Prince’s visit to the Boro
Budoor may therefore be put at a few years less
than fifty after Ki Mas Dana’s rebellion.</p>

<p>It is clear, says Dr. Brandes, that at the time
referred to in this second record, the Boro Budoor
was something more to the natives than simply a hill;
they knew of the building with the thousand statues&mdash;a
round number like that of the <i>chandi</i> Sewu, the
“thousand temples”&mdash;and they knew of the images
in the bell-shaped <i>chaityas</i> on the circular terraces.
And though any one of those 72 statues or even
the principal statue in the central dagob may
have been meant, in which last case, however,
another expression than <i>kuroongan</i> (cage) would
appear more appropriate, we think involuntarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
of the Sang Bimo or Kaki Bimo so-called, a statue
of the Buddha promoted or degraded by popular
superstition to the rank of a Pandawa, Arjuno’s
chivalrous brother, seated in the <i>chaitya</i> of the
lowest circular terrace, next to and south of the
eastern staircase, still venerated by the natives, by
the Chinese community and by more women and
men of European extraction than are willing to
confess it. Bimo or Wergodoro, to use the name
given to him in the <i>wayang lakons</i> when they extol
his youthful exploits, is the archetype of the <i>satrya</i>,
the pattern of ancestral knighthood. Most probably
it was Sang Bimo who, conformably to the
<i>ilaila</i> or ancient prediction, executed the decree of
fate on Pangeran Adipati Hamangkunagara. Disregarding
the example set by the invisible power
which resides in the Boro Budoor, a later Crown
Prince of Jogjakarta visited that temple in 1900
without, so far, coming to grief. Has then the
<i>ilaila</i> under special consideration lost its efficacy?
We must presume so, notwithstanding that the
occult forces identified with Sang Bimo and other
statues of the ancient fane, are affirmed still to work
miracles in plenty when propitiated by adequate
sacrifice.</p>

<div class="caption">XXXVIII. ASCENDING TO THE DAGOB OF THE BORO BUDOOR<br />(Cephas Sr.)</div>
</div>

<p>The greatest miracle of all is the elation of man’s
thought by the irresistible charm which goes out
from it. A night with the Boro Budoor is a night
of purification, when Amitabha offers the lotus of
the good law and the gift is accepted; when the
wonderful edifice, rising to the star-spangled sky,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
unfolds terrace after terrace and gallery after gallery
between the domed and pinnacled walls, as his flower
of ecstatic meditation spreads its petals, opens its
heart of beauty to the fructifying touch of heaven;
when tranquil love descends in waves of contentment,
unspeakable satisfaction. The dagob loses
its sharp, bold outline and melts into boundless
space, a vision of fading existence in consummation
of wisdom. A mysterious voice, proceeding
from the shrine, urges to search out the secret it
hides. The summons cannot be resisted and going
up, trusting to the murky night, mounting the steps
to the first gate as in a somnambulistic trance, the
seeker of enlightenment discerns the path, guided by
his quickened perception when the voice dies of its
own sweetness, the fragrant stillness appeasing the
mind and extending promise of pity for passion
and fleshly desire, the garment of sin left behind.
Surely, it was the supreme wisdom, forgiving all
things because it understands, which inspired a human
intellect to devise, directed human hands to achieve
in the delineation of mercy such powerful architectural
unity, sustained by such sublimely beauteous
ornament. Aided from above, the spirituality of
the builder, creating this masterpiece, needed not
the laborious tricks passed off on us in our days of
feverish <i>effect-hascherei</i> by artists who dispense with
the rudiments of their art to strive after the sensational.
Neither was his originality of the cheap
kind which tries to cloak crass technical ignorance
and hopeless general ineptitude with paltry though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
pretentious artifices, displaying a deplorable lack of
the conceptive faculty into the bargain. Proclaiming
the doctrine glorious in veracity of thought
and utterance, the Boro Budoor typifies honest
endeavour and sincerity of purpose.</p>

<p>Entering the first of the porches through which
from four sides the successive galleries and terraces
are reached, we come under the spell of the rapture
symbolised by those vaulted staircases, leading upward
from reason to faith, constructed, it seems, to
match the “evident portals” of the perfect state:
composure, kindness, modesty, self-knowledge. The
Banaspati, terrifier of the evil spirits, shelters him
who proceeds on the path they indicate in clemency
and charity. As we pass on, confiding in his protection,
the sculptured walls gleam softly, impregnated
by the sun’s light embedded in the stones, and the
germ of truth, treasured in the dagob, radiates down
in luminous substantiation of the word, making the
invisible visible by degrees. The air hangs heavy
and warm in the galleries and throbs with the
emotion excited by the lustrous reliefs which picture
the life of the Buddha. A flush of indescribable
splendour, clear exhalation of his virtue and holiness,
lifts veil after veil from the bliss this initiation
portends. The transparent atmosphere lends new
significance to the gestures of the Dhyani Buddhas,
seated on their lotus cushions as stars half quenched
in golden mist, while we feel more than see the
serene calmness of their features still wrapped in
obscurity. Their contemplation is the beginning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the highest; their ecstasy pierces eternity, opens the
regions of infinite intelligence, complete self-effacement,
absolute nothingness. Too much absorbed
in abstract cogitation to occupy themselves with
matters of mundane interest, they leave the government
of the created worlds to their spiritual sons,
and Padmapani is the Mahasatva on whom our age
depends. Out-topping human knowledge, they
teach the meaning of the universe: the Buddha of
the East dreaming his dreams as the sun rises, the
Buddha of the South blessing the day, the Buddha
of the West unfolding the secret of the all-spirit as
the sun sets, the Buddha of the North pointing the
way from darkness to light, the Buddha of the Zenith
lifting his hands to turn the wheel of the law. The
statues smile beatitude in happiness at losing the
consciousness of existence when they will be worthy
of the Nirvana, the solution of life in non-being,
death which disclaims resurrection in any form.
And the highest attainable blessing, the Paranirvana,
the Nirvana Absolute, is signified in the image of
the central dagob: however interpreted as solitary
indweller of the shrine of shrines built over the
remains of the flesh which embodied the word, the
Tathagata, the self-subsisting, preceded and to be
succeeded in fullness of time, it figures the immanence
in bodily imperfection of the energy for good
which sanctified Ayushmat Gautama, who modified
his carnality by dominating his senses; who, when
questioned by his first disciples, could declare that he
was the expected teacher of lucid perception and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
replete comprehension, the discerning monitor, the
destroyer of error, the spotless counsellor impelled
to release them from the bonds of sin and make them
deserve the manifest favour of annihilation.</p>

<p>The rudely interrupted sleep of the <i>recho bèlèt</i>
formulated, intentionally or not, a confession of faith
in the reward of righteousness by complete dissolution,
cessation of continuance, eternal rest undisturbed
by gods or men, by feeling or thought.
The pilgrim to the Boro Budoor, longing for the
<i>arahat</i>ship, accomplished in the science of conducting
himself, must have hesitated before ascending
to the highest terrace and seeking direct communion
with the pure spirit of the son of virtue, born of a
woman truly, but whose mother died seven days
after his birth, in token of his eminence; the venerable
one whose moral strength stands paramount,
overcometh even the innate fear of extinction. The
essence of the Triratna lies here within the grasp of
the earnest inquirer, the precious pearl whose lustre
divulges the principle of causation, the beginning
and the end of all things, the primary source of what
is and shall be. How to obtain it? By offerings
to the symbolic stone? Not so, but by good works
and self-examination which excels prayer and makes
any place a Bodhimanda, a seat of intelligence.
The Buddha was a man, no god surpassing the
limits of humanity, who has to be propitiated by
adoration. Whoso wishes the Rescuer’s saving
grace, should remember the story of Upagoopta and
the courtesan Vasavadatta, and ask: Has my hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
arrived?<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Penance for errors committed, not by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
fasting and self-torture, but by persevering in the
eight-fold path of right views, right aspirations, right
speech, right behaviour, right search of sustenance,
right effort, right mindfulness of our fellow-creatures,
right exultation, should ward off the dire
punishment of remorse which in well-balanced spirits
cannot dwell. Self-restraint, uprightness, control of
the organs of sense, makes the fell fire of the three
deadly sins&mdash;sensuality, ill-will and moral sluggishness&mdash;die
out in the heart by a proper arrangement
of the precious vestments, the six cardinal virtues:
charity, cleanness, patience, courage, contemplative
sympathy with all creation and discrimination of
good and evil. This leads to perfection, advancement
to the highest of the four sublime conditions,
the Brahma Viharas on which Buddhism improved
by making equanimity with regard to one’s own joys
and sorrows the test of progress on the road which
leads to bliss in extermination of pain. Loosen the
shackles of worldly existence by constant application
to escape from the fatal thraldom imposed by birth
and rebirth! Life is continued misery; no salvation
from the distress caused by passion and sin
is possible except by cessation of self, by merging
individual in universal vacancy, mounting the
four steps of the Dhyana in contemplative evolution
of the Nirvana, refining perception and speculation
to total impassibility, extinguishing reason itself in
eternal voidness, where we have nothing to fear and
nothing to hope for, taking refuge in non-existence,
the only conceivable verity.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>Heart and head rebel against such a religion,
which considers conscious life the great enemy to
be destroyed, seeks life’s meed in dissolution of
energy, man’s best part flickering out as the flame
of a spent candle. With the gladdening odour of
the garden of Java in our nostrils, rational instinct
struggles free from the torment of imposed passivity
and we rather take a more militant stand concordant
with the Buddha’s dying words: Work out your
salvation with diligence. How is it to be done?
Shall we turn for guidance to the creed of the men
of power and pelf, who seem to think that their best
recommendation to divine favour is the defacement,
in their western theological mill, of the gospel they
received from the East; whose mouths are filled
with promises while their hands sow calamity; whose
moral superiority is but a delusion; who mar impiously
what they pretend to improve; who boast of
investing their moral surplus in political efficiency,
as King Siladitiya did, for the benefit of their wards,
but whose greedy immorality spoils even the
reckoning of their own selfishness! Not so: their
deeds giving the lie to their words, their iniquities
increasing, their trespasses growing up into the
heavens, who can wonder that the glory of the deity
they profess to worship, suffers in the estimation of
the native? And yet, how might Christianity thrive
in a soil prepared by the doctrine of elimination of
self, by adherence to the three duties Buddhism
laid down as far more important than Brahmanic
sacrifice: continence, kindness, reverence for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
life of all creatures. Insisting on man’s obligations
to his fellow-men, the Buddha anticipated by six
centuries the precept: Thou shalt love thy neighbour
as thyself. If he did not match it with the first and
greater commandment of the Christian dispensation,
his atheism, to quote Hunter, was a philosophical
tenet which, so far from weakening the sanctions
of right and wrong, gave them new strength from
the doctrine of Karma or the metempsychosis of
character. Teaching that sin, sorrow and deliverance,
the state of a man in this life, in all previous
and all future lives, is the inevitable result of his
own acts, the Buddha applied the inexorable law of
cause and effect to the soul: What we sow, we must
reap. “All spirits are enslaved which serve things
evil,” as redemption flowers from straight vision,
straight thought, straight exertion in truthful endeavour.
The lesson might be profitably taken
to heart in furtherance of a nation’s Karma by
statesmen who have no explanation for the unsatisfactory
condition of dependencies oversea but
evasive oratory backed by a dexterous shuffling
of cooked colonial reports and doctored colonial
statistics when the sinister farce of the colonial
budget is on the boards. And each of us, however
limited his sphere, finds his own opportunities for
individual transition to a higher state: like Gautama
we meet every day the poor and needy, the old and
decrepit in want of assistance, the prostrate sufferer
in agony of death.</p>

<p>And, like Gautama, each one who strives for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
enfranchisement, must have his struggle with Mara,
the Prince of Darkness. After the first watch on
the Boro Budoor, night thickens and covers the
earth as a pall; the wan stars glimmer weakly,
shining on the misery of deficient fulfilment of
intention. Reflecting on our errors of commission
and omission, seeing our deeds laid bare and their
why and wherefore, dejection masters hope, though
steadfast determination might take an example at
the Buddha wrestling with the Enemy, who offered
him the kingdom of the four worlds; though we
know that the giving or withholding of the fifth,
the world of glory, is beyond the Enemy’s power.
We see the contest re-enacted before us and tremble.
Appearing bodily, horrible to behold, Mara, the
god of carnal love, passion and sin, Papiyan, the
very vicious, besets the incarnate word, surrounded
by his demons of ever changing gruesome aspect,
barking dogs with enormous fangs and lolling
tongues; roaring tigers with sharp, murderous claws
and bloodshot eyes; hissing serpents, darting forward
to strike and crush their prey. While we
fancy the contest raging hottest round valiant
patience, personified in the image of the dagob, the
maimed statues of the <i>chaityas</i> and lower niches
join in the dire battle as the headless spirits that
rode upon the tempest when Evil assailed the elect’s
purity. Papiyan cannot prevail and seeing the
futility of violence, he has recourse to his daughters,
the winsome <i>apsaras</i>, who dance and provoke to
lascivious commerce by their seductive arts. But they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
make no more impression than their brutish brothers
and, in spite of themselves, they are compelled to
praise the fortitude of a virtue which will not
succumb even when one of them assumes the shape
of a beloved youthful spouse. The baffled <i>apsaras</i>
dissolve in floating vapour, and Papiyan, in despair,
traces flaming characters on the dome of the dagob
with his last arrow: My empire is ended. The
stars resume their brightness and a sense of coming
light pervades the gloom of despondency. It is
borne toward us in the flower tendered by Chandra,
the deity of the chaste radiance proceeding from
the conqueror’s crest. Lo, his crown is transferred
to the sky and, climbing slowly, the cusped moon
invests the moulders of past and future worlds with
halos of liquid silver.</p>

<p>This is the time, the stilly hour before dawn, the
last watch before morning, the chosen moment of
the Buddha’s attainment to the summit of the triple
science, wherein the supernatural beauty of the
Boro Budoor, cleansed and reconsecrated after the
white man’s profanation, by the burning fire of
day and the mellow touch of night, helps us to
penetrate the meaning of his promise. He who
holds fast to the law and discipline and faints not,
he shall cross the ocean of life and make an end of
sorrow. The blitheness of spirit which consists,
because of that whereby the sun riseth and setteth,
and the moon waxeth and waneth, in discarding the
ignorance engendered by conceding to this world
a reality it does not possess, regarding as constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
that which changes with every wind that blows,&mdash;the
exaltation born from silent contemplation, loses
its vagueness in the manifestation of the godhead
in ourselves. For contemplation becomes seeded
and blooms in the triad of meditation, the recognition
of the entities of time and space, and connecting
thought as the unity of universal relationship. The
Dhyani Buddhas, wrapped in the shadows from
which dawn will deliver them, seek to comprehend,
and our mentality expanding with theirs, looking
down upon the gray waves of mist that break on
the old temple as on a rock of ages in a stormy sea,
we feel the dagob rise to meet the moonbeams
and soar to unutterable delight. Presently the first
smile of day salutes and awakens mother earth;
a murmur of contentment thrills the air in harmony
of praise: the dimming, quivering stars, the crimson
mountain-tops, the purple and azure perspective
between, all creation combines in a song of
thanksgiving. The mystic planetary music, the
singing together of earth and heaven in melody of
colour and sound, welcomes the bright morning.
Dawn, with blushing face and heart of gold, bewrays
the glory of her eternal abode to the world of man,
sending her outriders before, the Asvins, the lords
of lustre, whose shining armour, forged of the
sun’s rays, illumines the pearly sky with dazzling
splendour. They roll the billowy vapours together
and chase them up the hill-side “like wool of divers
changing colours carded,” that the eye of the life-giver
may rest on the plain where the palm-groves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
rise in the hazy dew as emerald islands in an
opalescent lake. The Merbabu and the Soombing
are still half in darkness when the Merapi, flecked
with orange and violet, blazes in reflection of aërial
effulgence, soon to commingle the smoke of its fiery
crater with the clouds mounting its slopes. The
fire-mountains keep a good watch on the garden of
Java, than which Jatawana, the famous pleasance
where the Buddha enounced the substance of his
teachings preserved in the Sutras, cannot have been
more delicious; and the Merapi in particular makes
the land pass under the rod when sacred covenants
are broken.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption">XL. THE DAGOB OF THE BORO BUDOOR AFTER ITS RESTORATION<br />(Archaeological Service.)</div>
</div>

<p>The heart too is illuminated as thoughts take
their hues from the skies, knowledge clearing up the
anarchy of conflicting creeds which exercised and
exercise their sway over Java. Brahmanic terrorism
and Buddhist despondency, Moslim fanaticism and
Christian dissensions vanish before her unsophisticated
children’s delight in life for its own sake, as
the morning dew before the warmth of the sun.
Twining memories of the <i>jaman buda</i> with current
happenings, they take their spiritual nourishment
directly from nature and the symbolic form of their
natural religion from everywhere. Without troubling
about erudite dissertations regarding the legend of
the Buddha as the development of an ancient solar
myth, or Buddhism as a development of the Sankhya
system of Kapila; without going into abstruse
speculations anent the evolution of the universe
from primordial matter, they are in constant inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>course
with the surrounding worlds, seen and unseen.
The virile Surya, impregnating air and earth, unfailing
source of plenty, enters deep into their metaphysics
as the cosmic pivot of faith. When high-born
dawn rouses the tillers of the soil to go forth
to their work and the eye of day showers benediction,
the solar word, spoken from the eternal throne and
descending on wings of happiness, the living word,
is found emblazoned on the sea of light which floods
the Kadu just as the fertilising water of the mountain-rills
floods the <i>sawahs</i>;<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> is found embodied in
that superb temple, the Boro Budoor, whose soul, the
soul of humanity in communion with the all-soul, is
the soul of Java. Adorned with that priceless jewel
of sanctity, the plain lifts its sensuous loveliness to
heaven as the bride meets the caresses of her
wedded spouse, trembling with love. They obey
the divine law which bids them follow nature in
drinking the <i>amrita</i>, gaining immortality like the
gods in creation of life, which may change, yet
never dies, aging but reviving, the mystery of the
Trimoorti. Clothed with the resplendent atmosphere,
touched by the beams of the rising sun, its effulgent
dagob a mountain of gold, the Boro Budoor bursts
out in the bloom of excellence, not the sepulchre of
a discarded religion, of a fallen nation’s dreams, but
a token of the germinal truth of all religion, a
prophetic expression of things to be. The tide of
destiny runs not always in the same channel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
there is promise in the joy of day, promise of a
slaking of the thirst for freedom, an abatement of
the fever engendered by doubt of enfranchisement
always deferred. If hope endures in the battle with
darkness, patient fortitude will lead to victory. It
baulked the power of Mara and blunted the weapons
of the demons who assailed the Buddha and turned
aside the missiles which did not harm him but
changed into flowers before his feet, into garlands
suspended over his head. When knowledge shall
cover the world at the advent of Vishvapani, deceit
and avarice will cease tormenting and glad content
will dwell in the <i>negri jawa</i> for ever.</p>

<p>So be it!</p>

<h2>BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>


<p>It has been suggested that the practical value of this volume might
be enhanced by the addition of a short bibliography indicating the
works to which students, who wish to go deeper into the subjects
touched upon, could turn for more ample information. <i>Il y a
l’embarras du choix</i> and, always abreast with latest research, particularly
the publications of learned societies as the Royal Institute
of the Dutch East Indies, the Royal Geographical Society of the
Netherlands, the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences, are rich
depositories of Dutch East Indian lore, many of the most important
monographs they contain, being available in book or pamphlet
form. Not to speak of the specific knowledge derivable from such
sources as the official Reports of the Archaeological Commission for
Java and Madura, the Bulletins of the Colonial Museum at Haarlem,
etc., from periodicals as <i>Het Tijdschrift voor Binnenlandsch Bestuur</i>
(organ of the Dutch East Indian Civil Service), <i>Het Indisch Militair
Tijdschrift</i>, etc., less scientifically or professionally dressed but just
as weighty observations on different aspects of Dutch rule in the
Malay Archipelago can be found in monthlies like <i>De Gids</i>, <i>De
Tijdspiegel</i> and, of course, <i>De Indische Gids</i> in which <i>Het Tijdschrift
voor Nederlandsch Indië</i>, founded by W. R. Baron van
Hoëvell, has been incorporated. The <i>Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch
Indië</i> is a very serviceable storehouse of general intelligence,
though new discoveries made and old theories exploded since its
appearance, emphasise more forcibly with every year, the necessity
of its usefulness being sustained if not by occasional new editions,
revised and brought up to date, then at least by frequent supplements.
The <i>Daghregisters</i> of the Castle of Batavia, the <i>Nederlandsch
Indisch Plakaatboek</i> (1602-1811), the <i>Realia</i>, a register of
the General Resolutions from 1632 to 1805, offer almost inexhaustible
material for the history of Java and the other islands in
the days of the Dutch East India Company. J. C. Hooykaas’
<i>Repertorium</i> (1595-1816), continued by A. Hartmann up to 1893,
and by W. J. P. J. Schalker and W. C. Muller up to 1910, furnishes
an excellent index to Dutch colonial literature; C. M. Kan’s
<i>Proeve eener Geographische Bibliographie van Nederlandsch Oost-Indië</i>
(1865-1880) and Martinus Nijhoff’s <i>Bibliotheca Neerlando-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>Indica</i>,
1893, should also be mentioned. The following miscellaneous
list is an attempt briefly to enumerate the works, apart from papers
accessible only in serial publications, which seem specially adapted
(allowing a good deal in not a few of them for mutual admiration
and all too courteous, excessive panegyric) to give interested
readers further particulars, according to each one’s individual line
of investigation, with regard to various matters treated of or alluded
to in Monumental Java.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_169_169" id="Footnote_169_169"></a><a href="#FNanchor_169_169"><span class="label">[169]</span></a> The story points a moral not less relevant to western than to eastern ethics
and runs as follows:
</p>
<p>
Once upon a time there lived in Mathura a courtesan renowned for her
beauty and her name was Vasavadatta. On a certain day her maid, having
been sent to buy perfume at a merchant’s, who had a son called Upagoopta, and
having stayed out rather long, she said:
</p>
<p>
&mdash;It appears, my dear, that this youth Upagoopta pleases you exceedingly
well, since you never buy in any shop but his father’s.
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Daughter of my master, answered the maid, besides being comely, clever
and polite, Upagoopta, the son of the merchant, passes his life in observing
the law.
</p>
<p>
These words awakened in Vasavadatta’s heart a desire to meet Upagoopta
and she bade her maid go back and make an appointment with him. But the
youth vouchsafed no other reply than:&mdash;My sister, the hour has not yet arrived.
</p>
<p>
Vasavadatta thought that Upagoopta refused because he could not afford to
pay the high price she demanded for her favours, and she bade her maid tell
him that she did not intend to charge him a single cowry if only he would come.
But Upagoopta replied in the same words:&mdash;My sister, the hour has not yet
arrived.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after, the courtesan Vasavadatta, annoyed by the jealousy of one of
her lovers, who objected to her selling herself to a wealthy old voluptuary,
ordered her servants to kill the troublesome fellow. They did so without taking
sufficient precautions against discovery; the crime became known and the
King of Mathura commanded the executioner to cut off her hands, feet and
nose, and abandon her thus mutilated among the graves of the dead.
</p>
<p>
Upagoopta hearing of it, said to himself: When she was arrayed in fine
clothes and no jewels were rare and costly enough to adorn her body, it was a
counsel of wisdom for those who aspire to liberation from the bondage of sin
to avoid her; with her beauty, however, she has certainly lost her pride and
lustfulness, and this is the hour.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, Upagoopta went up to the cemetery where the executioner
had left Vasavadatta maimed and disfigured. The maid, having remained
faithful, saw him approach and informed her mistress who, in a last effort at
coquetterie, told her to cover the hideous wounds with a piece of cloth. Then,
bowing her head before her visitor, Vasavadatta spoke:
</p>
<p>
&mdash;My master, when my body was sweet as a flower, clothed in rich garments
and decked with pearls and rubies; when I was goodly to behold, you made
me unhappy by refusing to meet me. Why do you come now to look at one
from whom all charm and pleasure has fled, a frightful wreck, soiled with blood
and filth?
</p>
<p>
&mdash;My sister, answered Upagoopta, the attraction of your charms and the
love of the pleasures they held out, could not move me; but the delights of this
world having revealed their hollowness, here I am to bring the consolation of
the lotus of the law.
</p>
<p>
So the son of the merchant comforted the courtesan doing penance for her
transgressions, and she died in a confession of faith to the word of the Buddha,
hopeful of rebirth on a plane of chastened existence.</p></div>
